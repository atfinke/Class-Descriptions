MUSIC,GEN_MUS 101-6-1 First-Year Seminar,1st Rehearse to Final Perform,MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM,160,RCMA 1-164,"['Freshmen;Sophmores', 'AddInstructorConsent']",,"This seminar is designed for the general campus student. Students with a music major, or a dual degree with music, are not permitted to register for this seminar. The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts - you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six to eight hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions. During and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus - during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life. After Week One's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice). Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CDs will learn a variety of conducting techniques - mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate interpretation, phrasing, dynamic shading. You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts."
MUSIC,GEN_MUS 230-0-1 History of Opera,,TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM,160,RCMA 1-180,[],,"This introductory survey of opera covers a span of over 400 years in its exploration of the genre's history as a form of staged musical drama. Beginning with the fundamental building blocks of the genre?such as the makeup of the operatic orchestra and the cast of singers?the class will then cover opera's early 17th-century origins before then progressing through the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, tracking opera's stylistic and thematic developments within each of these periods while also relating them to the larger sociopolitical changes which they may be seen to reflect. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions, regularly submit discussion posts in response to readings, and to view and listen to a selection of operas determined by the instructor."
MUSIC,GEN_MUS 170-0-1 Introduction to Music,,TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM,160,RCMA 1-176,[],,"This course introduces students to new ways of thinking about music, by examining the connections between musical practice and social, political, and cultural values: What is the role of music in today's world and how did it shape the generations of the 20th century? Topics will be inclusive of popular and World music, as well as Western art music. Through readings, active listening, written assignments, and concert attendance, students will develop a better cultural awareness through musical knowledge. Assessments also include quizzes and exams for which students will be expected to prepare. This class does not require any prior musical training."

These concepts, or musical &quot;elements,&quot; include patterns such as scales in addition to parameters of melody, dynamics, rhythm, harmony, texture, and timbre. Readings and discussions will pertain to a variety of topics, perspectives, and methods including: music and social function, music and language, music and philosophy, and notation. Students will be evaluated on the basis of reading responses, participation in class discussions, attendance, quizzes, and a final project."
MUSIC,GEN_MUS 170-0-3 Introduction to Music,,MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM,160,RCMA 1-168,[],,"This course will be a concentrated survey of Western music from the Baroque period to the 20th century. With an emphasis on principal composers, musicians, and genres, we will examine and learn to appreciate aspects of musical style and aesthetics. Students will be expected to learn to recognize stylistic trends in music history, identify the works of major composers and/or schools of composition or performance, analyze music using appropriate vocabulary, and place musical works within their historical and social contexts. Student evaluation will be based on quizzes, a midterm and final exam, a presentation, participation, and exercises to be completed during each class meeting."

While all forms of musicmaking involve some degree of spontaneity and active decision-making, free improvisation - in other words, playing without reference to any preconceived plan or genre (e.g. jazz, rock, or Indian classical music) - requires a unique set of skills. In this class, we will learn how to play &quot;free&quot; together by analyzing the foundations of our own musical languages, using practical musicianship exercises, as well as reading about the practice of improvised music as a late 20th-century genre and way of thinking. <br/>Any musician of any skill level, style, or instrument (including voice, electronics, objects, or custom-made instruments) is welcome. The main qualification is having an open mind and arriving ready to play. Class will consist of discussions of assigned materials, workshops developing improvisational skill, and performances in and out of class."
MUSIC,GEN_MUS 175-0-1 Selected Topics in Music Literature for Non-Majors,Music and the Visual Arts,TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM,160,RCMA 1-180,[],,"What does music have to do with painting? What does musical time have to do with biological rhythms and our perception of visual media? How does the combination of image and sound affect our experience with music videos, film, or live performances? In this course, we will investigate the historical and conceptual correspondences between music and the visual arts, with a particular emphasis on Western practice. We will cover a broad range of topics that includes but is not limited to impressionism, abstract expressionism, chance procedures, psychoacoustics and visual perception, sound installation, abstract and commercial animation, film and television, music videos, etc. Through this survey, we will seek to understand how the development and introduction of artistic movements and techniques were informed by creators from the two disciplines, with the hope that this knowledge will open new modes of thinking for our own practice as creative individuals. Student evaluation will be based on active participation in class discussions, reading and listening assignments, written work, and final presentations."
MUSIC,GEN_MUS 175-0-2 Selected Topics in Music Literature for Non-Majors,Celtic Music and Pop Culture,MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM,160,RCMA 1-180,[],,"Haunting, traditional, ancient, local, and ethereal are just some of the words used to describe &quot;Celtic music&quot; when it is heard today, whether at a Riverdance performance, on the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, or in the Black &amp; White video game series. The term remains extremely ambiguous, however, and this class will interrogate the idea of &quot;Celtic music&quot; and its place in 20th- and 21st-century popular culture. Our examination begins by understanding the historical evolution of the umbrella term &quot;Celtic&quot; and the host of national, cultural, ethnic, and linguistic associations that it has come to represent. We will undertake case studies of music from the different regions affiliated with Celtic identity - Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany, among others - to garner a foundation for approaching the eclectic range of styles and genres typically categorized as &quot;Celtic.&quot; Assigned readings and listening examples will be explored in class discussion with student assessment based on participation, listening quizzes, short essays, and weekly journals."

Initially propelled by exponents of the Schenkerian theory, these advances were more recently fueled by representatives of the cognitive study of music, neo-Riemannian theory, and historical music theory, among others, and they brought about a rich inventory of analytical tools applicable to variety of musical repertoires. In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire. This combination of theoretical inquiry and practical application of analytical methods is reflected in the course design, in which in-class discussion of readings will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers."

Each student may take 2 ?free' absences, after which each will reduce the final grade by 5 points; this class is therefore not advisable for students who will be missing more than a few classes.","Motivation: This class will consider the triad music, thought, and language as a kind of puzzle: which of these two is least like the others? Typically the answer given is that music is the ?odd man out,' with thought being considered as linguistic or paralinguistic in essence. The instructor considers music as a great argument for thought being not essentially linguistic - language is then the ?odd man out.' <br/><br/>Content: We will take up the question of what &quot;musical thought&quot; is, and its relationship to visual, spatial, kinesthetic, mathematical, and linguistic cognition. Readings will come from music theory, musicology, psychology, and philosophy. No textbook is required; there are no prerequisites, but readings will present different levels of difficulty to students from different backgrounds (those with music backgrounds will find the music readings easier than the psychology ones, etc)."

MUSIC,MUS_THRY 450-0-1 Seminar in Music Theory &amp; Cognition,Trans/formational Theories,Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM,170,RCMA Lower Level 115,[],,"This seminar will be theoretical and conceptual in orientation, bringing two ostensibly disparate discursive spheres into dialogue. The first of these is the broad realm of gender and sexuality studies known as trans or transgender studies, and the second is transformational theory, a major subfield of contemporary North American music theory since the 1990s. Theories of trans identity are highly contested, explicitly political, and culturally current. Transformational theory is largely formalist (albeit with a pronounced and seemingly paradoxical phenomenological substrate). In this seminar we will consider the ways in which these intellectually distinct areas of thought might speak to each other.<br/><br/> The most readily apparent common thread between the two involves a set of questions around what it means to move from one state to another?or, alternately, how the distance or space between states is to be understood. The distinction between these modalities is absolutely crucial to both areas of thought, and both theorize the distinction in explicit terms. David Lewin, who came to be understood as the founder of transformational theory, begins his seminal book &quot;Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations&quot; with a simple diagram of a unidirectional arrow. Colloquially known as &quot;Lewin's arrow,&quot; the meaning of the diagram has been widely glossed as &quot;the interval from s to t is i,&quot; where &quot;interval&quot; refers to &quot;directed measurement, distance, or motion&quot; between any two entities (not necessarily pitches) within a defined musical &quot;space&quot; (Rings 2011, 12; Lewin 1987, xxix). Note the distinction between &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;motion&quot;; these concepts subsequently form the two main theoretical foundations of Lewin's approach. <br/><br/> Almost thirty years later, in an essay on trans identity in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, Jacqueline Rose counterposes the perspective offered by trans theorist Jay Prosser, for whom the &quot;move from A to B is a conclusive self-fashioning or it is nothing,&quot; with that of Kate Bornstein, for whom &quot;in her new life, as for [Susan] Stryker, transsexuality is an infinite confusion of tongues&quot; (vol. 38:9, May 2016). In trans theory, and more specifically in theories of &quot;transition,&quot; a unidirectional arrow can represent directed motion toward a stable alignment of body and identity whose realness is absolutely crucial, while for others the line has no arrow, is infinitely divisible, or is completely unsuitable as a model.<br/><br/> Major questions posed by this course include the following:<br/>? How can the diverse perspectives on transition articulated by trans theorists and activists productively destabilize certain widespread assumptions within music theory?<br/>? What can music theory, in which &quot;transition&quot; is a fundamental concept in contexts ranging from the undergraduate classroom to the most rarified intellectual circles, contribute to broader discourse on the subject?<br/><br/>Students in the course should have an advanced understanding of music theory as a professional discipline and fluency in musical analysis. The final project will be a substantial theoretical and/or analytical paper."

MUSIC,MUSICOL 346-0-1 Composer Topics,Beethoven,TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM,160,RCMA Lower Level 121,[],,"Scholars, critics, and concertgoers alike regularly characterize Ludwig van Beethoven as the West's, if not the world's, &quot;greatest composer.&quot; Why? The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven's music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century. This course aims to better understand Beethoven's music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven's vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven's expansion of music genres; exploring important performers of Beethoven's music; understanding connections between Beethoven's music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today in a global context. Although it is a fairly large 300-level class, it will be run as a pro-seminar, meaning graduate-level group discussion of scholarly readings from upper level academic journals, and independent research work, is expected of all students. Students taking this course should have some background in music history and performance; some reading knowledge of German is a plus. This is a historical course, not a music theory/analysis course. This year we will also analyze the many &quot;Beethoven 250&quot; events happening around the world."

Textual languages include not only The Bard's original English and its more modern forms, but also French, German, Hindi, Italian, and Russian, for starters. Because the original productions of all of Shakespeare's plays included music, and each one has inspired many musical interpretations since that time, we will concentrate on three. Students will have the opportunity to work with other plays for research and/or performance projects."

On the one hand, antitrust laws seek to restrict exclusionary or exploitative behavior by dominant firms and to prevent collusion among firms against their customers and consumers. On the other hand, intellectual property laws seek to incentivize innovation by creating de facto monopolies over patentable technologies and by granting other exclusive rights through the enforcement of trademarks, copyright, trade dress, and trade secrets. What happens when these systems collide? In this class, we will explore antitrust enforcement and doctrine as applied the the technology sector, examine how Silicon Valley companies seek to protect and police their intellectual property, and discuss how in-house counsel and enforcers balance the competing interests of fostering innovation while combating anti competitive and exclusionary activity."

Managers must determine the value of building a factory, entering a new market, or purchasing an entire firm when deciding in which projects to invest. Similarly, individuals must assess the value of financial securities to decide how to invest their wealth. Finance 1 teaches methods for valuing projects or assets. These valuation tools lay the foundation for all work in capital markets and corporate finance. Law students will be able to better understand the decision-making of their clients, participate in the multidisciplinary teams necessary to execute complex transactions, and assess financial issues arising in litigation, regulation, and other contexts.<br/>Prerequisites The prerequisites for this course are knowledge of probability and statistics through linear regression and accounting."

Specific topics for study and analysis include the foundational doctrines of original Indian title; inherent tribal sovereignty; congressional plenary authority over American Indian affairs; and the federal trust duty to protect American Indian lands and rights. These doctrines' impact on the contemporary lives, resources, cultures, and rights of the American Indian peoples will be evaluated within selected legal frameworks. <br/><br/>Federal Indian law is of obvious relevance to those students with an interest in our indigenous nations and their populations. Less obvious, however, is the importance of rulings in the field for law more broadly defined. For example, Chief Justice John Marshall's opinions in the so-called Cherokee cases of the early 1800s were foundational in determining the obligation of states to abide by decisions of the Supreme Court. Further, understanding Federal Indian law is crucial for any lawyer who represents a tribe or advises investors whose capital is to be connected, even if only in a tenuous way, with a federally recognized tribe. <br/><br/>After covering the foundational material, this course examines in greater depth selected specialized areas such as: civil and criminal jurisdiction within Indian country; missing and murdered indigenous women; environmental law; taxation; cultural and religious freedoms; child welfare law; gaming; economic development; reserved water rights; food sovereignty; cultural sovereignty; and hunting and fishing rights. The areas to be covered will be determined early in the first half of the course."

Controversially, many claim that U.S. courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a U.S. lawyer or judge? How to optimize one's understanding?"

There is an emerging consensus in both parties and all three branches of government that the criminal system is malfunctioning in ways that do profound damage to the country, but consensus stops there. On one side are those who think the root of the crisis is the American public, and the solution is to place control over the criminal system in the hands of officials and experts. On the other side are those who think the root of the crisis is a set of bureaucratic structures divorced from the American public's concerns and sense of justice, and the solution is to make criminal justice more community-focused. <br/><br/>This course will examine criminal justice reform from two theoretical perspectives. We will first examine the two perspectives themselves. We will then bring the two perspectives to bear on three of the major headings of the contemporary crisis: criminalization, sentencing, and plea bargaining. We will close by examining some of the major proposals for policy reform.<br/><br/>Course Particulars: This course is a seminar, with a heavy emphasis on reading, writing, and discussion."

Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, using the pen name &quot;Publius,&quot; wrote the Papers in support of the ratification of the Constitution proposed by the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. <br/><br/>The purpose of this seminar is to conduct a close reading of the leading numbers of the Federalist Papers, paying particular attention to their historical context and their implications for later legal and political developments. We will also read and discuss some of the most prominent Anti-Federalist writers such as &quot;Brutus&quot; and the &quot;Federal Farmer,&quot; since it was their writings to which &quot;Publius&quot; was often responding; as well as Montesquieu, whose ideas were so influential on both Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Finally, we will discuss the fascinating relationship between the two primary authors, Hamilton and Madison, who were united in this project but quickly became political enemies in the administration of President George Washington. How did this happen and with what implications for subsequent American history?"

Ethiopia Project: We will continue our work with our Ethiopian NGO partners in challenging the privately-owned Lega Dembi Gold Mine, which has poisoned the environment and devastated the lives and livelihoods of the indigenous agro-pastoral Guji people. In January and October 2019, clinic students traveled to Ethiopia to meet with our NGO partners and to interview victims, Guji elders, Ethiopian lawyers, health workers, mine employees, local university experts, and others; we may or may not return during Spring 2020 for further meetings and fact-finding. Thus far we have prepared reports to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review mechanism, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Procedures human rights complaint mechanism. Students traveled to Geneva in 2019 to participate in the CEDAW session and the UPR Pre-Session; during Spring 2020 we hope to participate in the Human Rights Council's full-day discussion of children's right to a healthy environment, including by organizing a side event during this session on the impacts on children of toxic contamination by extractive industries. We also hope to collaborate with Ethiopian attorneys on either litigation in Ethiopian courts or a complaint to the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. Students will also participate in our ongoing strategizing on how to move our advocacy work forward.<br/><br/>2. Migrants Rights Project: (a) The role of private security companies in the detention and other abusive treatment of migrants has elicited the concern of the UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries (WG), which is one of the UN Human Rights Council's Special Procedures. The WG has asked our clinic to prepare a comprehensive report on the role of private companies in the detention and other treatment of migrants fleeing, or trying to flee, across the U.S./Mexico border. The WG, which receives and responds to complaints of human rights violations relevant to their mandate, has encouraged us also to file complaints on behalf of individual migrants who are victims of human rights violations by these private security companies. This project will be a collaboration between Prof. Bridget Arimond's IHR Advocacy Clinic class and Prof. Carolyn Frazier's International Children's Rights Advocacy Clinic. Students working on this project will be involved in extensive research, interviewing, analysis and writing. It is anticipated that during Spring 2020 students working on this project will travel to one of the migrant detention centers to interview NGO advocates as well as, if possible, detained migrants themselves. (b) Students will also do research and analysis to explore the viability of a federal court class action lawsuit under the jurisdiction provided by the Alien Tort Statute, to recover damages for victims of the Trump Administration's 2018 family separation policy. If it is concluded that such a suit is viable, we will move ahead to file suit together with NGO and pro bono law firm partners.<br/><br/>3. LGBT Rights Project: Working in partnership with the NGO Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), we will prepare a report on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Uganda. This may lead to additional collaborative work with SMUG, possibly including the development and implementation of training workshops for human rights defenders."

Energy is also at the heart of the dramatic rise in global warming and the unprecedented damage this warming is causing to our climate, our environment and our selves. This means we are faced with a challenge: how do we continue to support worldwide economic growth and the quality of life for millions it will provide, an economic growth which in large part still must be fueled by energy consumption, yet at the same time significantly reduce the global warming caused by the very GHG emissions such energy consumption has spawned and address and adapt to the adverse climate change impacts that are already baked into our climate system. This class will explore the law's role in meeting this existential challenge. <br/><br/>The objective of this course is to provide an overview of the major legal principles, statutes, regulations and policies applicable to the energy area; explore from a legal perspective some of the significant issues in the energy space today, with a focus on climate change; and use the intersection of energy and the law to examine the process by which our society makes major public policy, commercial and individual decisions involving complex issues of science and technology."

In Reporting Chicago Through LGBTQ Health, Medill students will learn how to explore, navigate and report upon the Windy City by learning how to report about the health of its LGBTQ people. Meeting inside of Northwestern's Institute of Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing (or ISGMH, the largest university-based research center in the world dedicated to LGBTQ health) in downtown Chicago, and working with the Chicago Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), student journalists will meet most weeks with researchers at the forefront of queer and trans health. Student journalists will have the chance to learn from and question researchers, as well as to work with them to develop story leads surrounding the researcher's data that has been under-reported; these collaborations will form the basis of news and feature stories the student journalists will report in the course. Journalism methods to be explored will include how to: interview scientists; translate peer-reviewed scientific literature into popular journalism; blog about on-going research; and, write about sexual and gender minorities with respect. Research topics will include queer theory, LGBTQ activism in Chicago, intersex medical history, Chicago's LGBTQ media, HIV/AIDS epidemiology, virology, and how researchers are using geolocation apps like Grindr and Tindr. Field trips may include trips to the The Center on Halsted, the Puerto Rican Culture Center, the Stony Island Arts Bank, and visiting active biomedical laboratories.

What is involved in transforming a community from one that is low-income to high income? What are the positives and negatives of gentrification?

It is also poised precariously to adjust to, respond to, and be roiled by changes in immigration and refugee policies and practices that accompany the Trump administration. <br/><br/>The Chicago area ranks 5th among metropolitan areas in immigrant population. Chicago itself is more than 20% foreign born; home to almost 600,000 immigrants and refugees. Suburban Cook County is home to another 500,000 and growing. <br/><br/>Immigrant groups aren't monolithic. They have both divergent and shared needs and interests. More than 50 percent of the Chicago-area immigrants, for instance, were born in three completely distinct parts of the world - Mexico, Poland, and India. Moreover, the balance of the immigrant population is even more diverse, with no country of origin comprising more than five percent of the population. In some ways, though, aggregate statistics or assumptions on the foreign born do more to mask their characteristics and concerns than to illuminate them. Through stories, we cross ethnic, cultural, neighborhood and generational lines to document immigrant and refugee experiences that are as varied as the people involved. Though those stories surface every day, they often go untold, unshared and unappreciated. <br/><br/>This course will provide you opportunities to tell multimedia immigrant and refugee stories for publication and to create a social network across ethnic lines. By focusing on global immigration and refugee phenomena, with a watchful eye on national policy and the first 100 days of an administration that seems to have targeted immigrants and refugees for special concern and treatment, the course will expose you to the communities where immigrants and refugees live and work, and in partnership with ethnic media outlets in the city and suburbs and with Immigrant Connect Chicago, an online network for immigrants, refugees, their families and communities, you will produce stories that matter and that animate the lives of those who give you access to their experiences and families."

The class will take field trips so that students can talk with political, business and community leaders, as well as residents and fans, in the neighborhoods around the two ballparks such as Bronzeville and Bridgeport near Guaranteed Rate Field and Uptown and Lake View by Wrigley Field.

Potential reporting topics include gentrification around the ballparks that makes affordable housing less available, the growth of nearby entertainment venues, the efforts of local social service organizations, the struggles of neighborhood businesses and the cultural identification of residents with the teams' players.

Whether it's deciding how to save to pay for an education or how much money a government should spend on social services, money is front and center. <br/> <br/>In Chile, like other countries, decisions about money have been impacted by politics. Chile was under a military dictatorship between 1973 and 1990, and its economy was influenced by the Chicago Boys in the 1970s and 1980s. And although the quality of life for Chileans has improved significantly over the last decades - supported by a stable economy, plenty of natural resources (especially copper) and political stability - the country still faces challenges tied directly and indirectly to money. Chile has a relatively low poverty rate, but it has a high income inequality rate. The country has an aging population and although its population is growing, it's doing so at a slower rate and that poses challenges for supporting the older generation. More women are entering the workforce, but Chile has a relatively low rate of female employment. Mining is a key contributor to the country's economy, but younger Chileans favor jobs in the e-commerce, digital and financial industries. <br/> <br/>In this course, students will look at what influences Chilean residents when they make decisions about money: how they make it, how they spend it, how they save it.

How his use of dramatic rhetoric enabled him to convey his complex political ideas in a theatrical form in plays that continue to delight and entertain audiences today. This tutorial will focus on Shaw's own views on the actor's vocal craft using his writings and the recollections of professional actors and directors who worked with him. Students will work on the vocal rhetoric of Shaw's theatrical language through selected scenes and speeches from a variety of Shaw plays to explore how actors today can acquire the vocal ability to perform his work with skill and <br/>professionalism. <br/><br/>The class will culminate in a performance of excerpts from scenes by George Bernard Shaw worked on in class for an invited audience at Northwestern.

Why do we get the news that we get? And why should we care about all this?<br/>This course looks at ethnographies of artistic practice to better understand how culture is made, circulated, and received in social life. Aiming to go beyond the personal idiosyncrasies of individual artists and media players, it shows through a myriad of studies in cultural production, what are the factors that play the greatest role in shaping contemporary cultural production: is it about professional traditions, forms of ownership and funding, government regulations, organizational factors or the social dynamics in the interplay between owners, workers, and audiences? Sorting out the factors that shape cultural production can best be accomplished via comparative research - across geographical regions, and institutional fields.

Aiming to go beyond the personal idiosyncrasies of individual artists and media players, it shows through a myriad of studies in cultural production, what are the factors that play the greatest role in shaping contemporary cultural production: is it about professional traditions, forms of ownership and funding, government regulations, organizational factors or the social dynamics in the interplay between owners, workers, and audiences? Sorting out the factors that shape cultural production can best be accomplished via comparative research - across geographical regions, and institutional fields.

Students will learn how to conduct in-depth interviews, on a particular topic, to gather oral narratives and their meanings from specific family, friends, or community members. (2) Myth. Students will read and discuss ancient and contemporary myths to unravel deeper questions about local and global experiences. (3) News Reports. Through guided instruction students will select a current news story, from electronic or newspaper journalism, they feel reveals an urgent issue they are compelled to share. Each of the three units will culminate in a performance: a solo performance of an oral narrative, a group performance of a myth and, finally, a multi-media group performance of a news story.

Students will explore works from Folklore Studies and Queer Studies side by side to allow for the unusual conversation between these two fields. Particularly, students will develop skills in textual, visual, performance, and ethnographic analysis, which will enable them to theorize and define folklore in new ways. By exploring a wide range of performance practices such as patron-saint festivals, dance, carnivals, rituals, music, oral traditions, and performance and visual art, we will examine how concepts such as tradition, religion, race and ethnicity, class, authenticity, and indigeneity have played important roles in defining folkloric practices as such. In this sense, we will ask how queerness is represented but also serves as an optic to look at folklore in more expansive and inclusive manners. Students will engage in written assignments, autoethnographic exercises, and a short performance project. Although we will engage our conversations hemispherically and globally, most of the case studies will focus on folklore in the Americas.

And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful hold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean to be an &quot;author&quot; in the creative industries? What is the nature of creative work? How are artistic reputations constructed and understood? What role do critics and audiences play in that process? Why some media texts have authors and others don't? How does collaboration work in the creative industries? In this course we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the transmedia career of David Lynch. <br/><br/>Lynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media forms, encompassing visual art, film, television, photography, furniture design, popular music, online films, digital cinematography, and virtual reality. Lynch can be seen as the ultimate crossover artist: a cult filmmaker who went on to have a hit network television series (&quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) the same year as winning the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Starting his career as a painter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After his first feature Eraserhead achieved the status of a cult classic on the &quot;midnight movie&quot; circuit, Lynch jumped into mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success with general audiences, cult fans, and academics. Films such as Blue Velvet became touchstones for film theorists during the 1980s, and are still discussed in academic circles today. Lynch has never been without his critics, and his work has come under fire for its depiction of women, sexual violence, race, and class. Lynch has often had creative control over his projects, and yet his distinctive &quot;Lynchian&quot; signature was forged through long-standing collaborative relationships with a cohort of actors, composers, editors, and sound designers. Lynch is thus a remarkably fertile case study for a consideration of media authorship, modes of collaboration in the creative industries, the history of film culture since the 1970s, the various logics of film, television, and digital media, the importance of sound design in audio-visual media, the representation of race, class, and gender, and a range of other issues."

SoC,SAI 400-0-20 Topics in Sound Studies,Meet David Lynch,MoWe 1:00PM - 2:30PM,180,Louis Hall 119,['AddDepartmentConsent'],"Students will be assessed through: ;<ol>;<li>a portfolio of short response papers;</li><li>three short videographic essays made using Adobe Premiere and clips from Lynch's oeuvre;</li><li>in-class reading quizzes;</li><li>a short critical review of the new &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; VR experience,</li>;</ol>","We know very well that media texts are collaborative projects: when we see the credits roll at the end of a major film for example, we see hundreds of names and numerous specialized tasks. And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful hold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean to be an &quot;author&quot; in the creative industries? What is the nature of creative work? How are artistic reputations constructed and understood? What role do critics and audiences play in that process? Why so some media texts have authors and others don't? How does collaboration work in the creative industries? In this course we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the transmedia career of David Lynch. <br/><br/>Lynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media forms, encompassing visual art, film, television, photography, furniture design, popular music, online films, digital cinematography, and virtual reality. Lynch can be seen as the ultimate crossover artist: a cult filmmaker who went on to have a hit network television series (&quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) the same year as winning the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Starting his career as a painter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After his first feature <em>Eraserhead</em> achieved the status of a cult classic on the &quot;midnight movie&quot; circuit, Lynch jumped into mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success with general audiences, cult fans, and academics. Films such as <em>Blue Velvet</em> became touchstones for film theorists during the 1980s, and are still discussed in academic circles today. Lynch has never been without his critics, and his work has come under fire for its depiction of women, sexual violence, race, and class. Lynch has often had creative control over his projects, and yet his distinctive &quot;Lynchian&quot; signature was forged through long-standing collaborative relationships with a cohort of actors, composers, editors, and sound designers. Lynch is thus a remarkably fertile case study for a consideration of media authorship, modes of collaboration in the creative industries, the history of film culture since the 1970s, the various logics of film, television, and digital media, the importance of sound design in audio-visual media, the representation of race, class, and gender, and a range of other issues."

This course is the most focused on learning of any LOC course. However, in contrast to a typical cognitive science or cognitive psychology class, most of the material in this course is set in organizational contexts. For example, when discussing judgment and decision making, we use examples from medical practice and policy and from sports organizations. Likewise, in discussing the cognition of memory, we will analyze examples from the legal system. Thus, although the primary focus is on learning and cognition, we do set these examples in organizational context.<br/><br/>The course is relevant for all students in SESP (and beyond). The class will expose you to a variety of methods, including instructional design, modeling, and evaluation of learning outcomes. It will help prepare you to design and evaluate learning programs and learning environments. Thus the course is appropriate for students who might become teachers, consultants, human resource or training managers, etc."

For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives.<br/><br/>Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors ? for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change.<br/><br/>Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning &amp; Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change."

Such shifts have been in part due to the rise of innovations in social enterprise. Engaging meaningfully in these organizations demands a thorough understanding of the sector landscape, a confidence employing strategic tools to advance sustainable change, and an active consideration of accountability in light of potential social transformations.<br/><br/>This course is designed to provide a survey of the civic engagement sector from a critical analytical perspective. After providing an overview of the sector, we will delve deeply into distinctive aspects of civic engagement such as youth as agents of change, sustainable impact, stakeholder engagement, philanthropy as a tool for social change, social innovation, models for global engagement, and more. We will focus on emerging models that provide novel approaches to sustainable engagement, and we will have the opportunity to explore the similarities, differences, and nuances of such approaches. Moreover, we will utilize case studies that focus on both small ventures and more established organizations to critically analyze core concepts of this course. <br/>We will read about and discuss issues confronting educational organizations, major corporations, small NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and social enterprises."

We will investigate how the relations between levels of government, the proclivities of front-line workers like teachers, social workers, or policeman, and organizational history and culture influences what policy actually looks like on the ground.<br/> <br/>Students will also learn to write and present a policy brief. They will work with a group on a quarterlong policy analysis project on a pressing social issue that culminates with a briefing and paper. Along the way, there will be six class periods devoted to reading about, critiquing, and working to develop policy briefs. Students will also write two individual papers related to their briefing topic early in the quarter so that they can get individual feedback on their writing and early support for the policy analysis project."

Teachers must communicate with students and foster an environment in which students can communicate with each other. Teachers must not only be comfortable themselves with public speaking; if a teacher wishes to assign oral presentations to his or her students, it is imperative that the teacher be able to assist those students as well. Teacher candidates in the class will be expected to make several small presentations, both to highlight different styles of public speaking, and also to simply grow comfortable speaking in front of others. Interpersonal communication, social emotional learning, and classroom management issues will be discussed. This class will satisfy the public speaking deficiency for licensure and will also count as a graduate-level elective for the Master of Science in Education degree."

In learning about the varying traditions of written and unwritten constitutions, civil and common law and the foundations and structures of separation of powers and judicial review of the constitutionality of laws in these countries, students will learn to think critically about the U.S. Constitution and the different ways in which constitutional democracies provide for public order, counter-majoritarian governance, equality and protection of the rights of minorities through rule of law and question whether constitutional solutions can address the kinds of social and political problems we have today."

The comparative and ethnographic study of language ideologies focuses on the historical and political economic experiences that shape these mediations.

Early declarations of the state's growing irrelevance in an era of globalization have proven to be grossly premature, as any migrant worker, prisoner, Palestinian struggling for statehood, South Sudanese celebrating statehood, or person in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles will tell you. Yet many questions abound. Is the nature of the state/subject relations changing with neoliberal globalization and if so, how? What might be similar across different state/subject formations, and what might be different - not only in this particular historical juncture but in previous ones as well? Do certain state/subject relations inhere in the very structure of the modern state and/or can we disrupt the universalist notion of the modern state as a Western form that takes &quot;alternative&quot; shape in different regions? How can we think about the state, both ethnographically and theoretically, in ways that do not always presume the state as an agent, a monolith, or a set of always coherent projects? What are the myriad ways that state projects shape particular subjects, and is this shaping always complete? What fissures appear and how? How do people engage or circumvent the state in their daily lives and in particular political struggles in ways that disrupt or collude with subject-making projects? Key themes to be explored include governmentality, sovereignty, citizenship, rights, materiality, space, and development. We will be especially concerned with understanding the current Foucauldian-inspired thinking on the state and try to think productively with and past it. Finally, we will continually ask how theory informs ethnography and vice-versa."

The death of the nation-state and the birth of the multinational corporation heralded this new epoch. Yet, in the epoch of off-shored refugee processing centers and border walls, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing to re-conceptualize border as equally the product of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements."

We will establish some basic urban-studies concepts and, with a special focus on Chicago, will then read together literary work, historical and social science studies, and contemporary journalism in order to consider misogyny/racism/xenophobia/classism and their effects on women's lives, and issues of women's employment, reproductive rights, sexuality, and violence against women. And, of course, women's own agency in attempting to live their urban lives, pursue their goals, and claim their equal rights and pleasures. We will also consider common representations?and misrepresentations-of varying women's urban lives. <br/> <br/>American women live in cities, work in cities, but have had to wage a fight that is by no means over to be accommodated in the urban world. From hostile built environments (e.g., lack of sufficient public women's bathrooms), ongoing lower salaries than men's, to the lack of subsidized childcare, to omnipresent harassment and sexual violence at work, at home, and in the public world, American cities are far more challenging environments for women than for men.<br/> <br/>We are living in a strange new cultural and political-economic arena, in which daily horrific racist/misogynist attacks and policies, from the White House down, jostle up against vibrant, active backlash and organizing by grassroots and other feminist and antiracist movements.

Archaeology offers nationalist agendas the possibility of filling in national historical records and extending the past far into prehistory. Its results can be displayed in museums, occupy entire sites, and be readily accessible online ?thus potentially reaching many new audiences beyond traditional print media. In turn, nationalism has contributed significantly to the development of archaeology as a modern discipline.<br/> <br/>Drawing on new critical approaches and examples selected from a wide geographical range, this course explores the role of archaeology in the creation and elaboration of national identities from the eighteenth century to the present day. Issues include the institutionalization of archaeology; the development of museums and practices of display and interpretation; the creation of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations; cultural property legislation and repatriation of artifacts; and archaeology and monuments under totalitarian regimes."

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a &quot;global consciousness&quot; and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and techno science to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;species&quot; are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament."

By examining trajectories of intra- and inter-national migration within and out of Latin America, this course will explore the social, cultural, economic, and political histories that reveal relationships between migration and larger global and postcolonial socio-economic forces. We will reflect on the reasons why individuals choose to become mobile, as well as the structural conditions that might compel them. Specifically, we will look at disparities between urban and rural populations, clashes over ownership of job markets in urban settings, and the formation of individual and collective migrant identities. The course will begin by studying how waves of migrants (within and across frontiers) after independence shaped contemporary ideologies of race and belonging in Latin America, and end with a reflection on what these trajectories can teach us about studying Latin American migrants in the &quot;Global North&quot; today.

Following the worldwide year of revolution (1848) insurgent forces, appeared in the artistic no less than the political arena. They demanded the abolition or reorganization of the conservative academies of art with their restrictive jury systems. They rejected the idea of artistic subservience to wealthy or powerful patrons, insisting that the first responsibility of artists is to themselves and their imaginations. And they preferred to depict the popular classes - their struggles as well as their heroism - instead of the established cannon of stories from ancient history and myth, or the Christian bible. There were many artistic radicals in this period, but we will focus on just a few, including Gustave Courbet, Honore Daumier, Francois Millet and Edouard Manet in France and the Pre-Raphaelites in England. By the end of the century, a different crisis arose. The modernists had so far dominated the scene, that the risk arose that audiences would be left behind. So thoroughly had Symbolist artists such as Redon, Gauguin, Hodler, Van Gogh, Ensor and Munch rejected traditional subjects, that their work was becoming almost incomprehensible to audiences. Even erstwhile Impressionists such as Monet, Degas and Cezanne confronted a crisis: Would they follow their own, creative and interrogative path wherever it led them, of would they retreat to more solid ground, surrendering the very idea of progress and experimentation? These are among the questions the course will address."

Last year, for example, a group called &quot;Decolonize this Place&quot; protested at the Whitney Museum of American Art, challenging both the financial affiliations of a prominent board member and the diversity of artists collected by a museum meant to represent American art, broadly speaking. While groups like &quot;Decolonize this Place&quot; participate in a long history of cultural practice called &quot;institutional critique&quot; and engage in extra-muros activist strategies, curators and other museum employees are now also engaged in this self-critical project. Indeed, these concerns are forefront in the Block Museum of Art's plans for an exhibition of contemporary art drawn from its own permanent collection and tentatively titled &quot;Thinking about History.&quot; Focused on artists who shape, present, and represent the past in their work, the exhibition also aspires to present a self-critical analysis of its own strategies for shaping its collection and promoting a set of social values in an educational context. This seminar will take up similar concerns. Looking at a history of critical museum studies and art associated with &quot;institutional critique,&quot; the course asks questions about the politics of museum finances; the ideological underpinnings of inclusion and exclusion; canon formation; boycotts; and what it means to &quot;decolonize&quot; the museum in relationship both to the history it presents and the futures it maps. The course culminates in the extraordinary opportunity for students to decide upon the purchase of a work of contemporary art for the Block's permanent collection that the group selects from local galleries and justifies to museum staff, arguing for the merits of the work, its relevance to the Block's teaching mission, and its relationship to &quot;Thinking about History.&quot; Students are required to attend one Saturday class visit to contemporary art galleries in the Chicago area, and some seminar sessions will be held off campus visiting museums and private collections. Interested students should write a formal letter of application to Prof. Feldman at h-feldman@northwestern.edu by February 15, outlining their intellectual reasons for wanting to take the course; the courses they have taken that have prepared them for this study of museum practices and contemporary art/history; their Saturday availability throughout the quarter; and, a brief reflection on what they think the museum brings to the construction of social values and understandings of the past, present, and future."

Aesthetics, scientific investigation, identity formation, political relations, and devotional practices were shaped by material goods, many of them newly available on a global scale. This seminar interrogates recent historiography and a variety of objects and artistic practices from around the globe, focusing on conditions of production, circumstances of exchange, and aesthetic considerations. We will consider the dissemination and valuation of artistic materials; the movement of goods, materials, persons, and knowledge around the globe; the concept of property and ownership in the context of global trade; the relationship between trade and knowledge formation.

Often associated with theorists Frank B. Wilderson III and Jared Sexton, the term refers to a series of political orientations that help us understand the paradigmatic antiblack violence that structures everyday Black life. These theoretical interventions have entered the popular culture, as artists, critics, and cultural producers across various contexts have turned to Afropessimism as both a framework for artistic production and a means of critical engagement with it. This class, co-taught with Sampada Aranke (School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Art History, Theory, and Criticism), will consider the possibilities of an 'Afropessimist Aesthetics' in the wake of such interventions. We will read works by scholars including but not limited to Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Frank B.

We will begin in the present and work our way backwards, looking first at the impact of globalization on the conditions underlying art making, exhibiting and viewing. Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life. <br/><br/>No prerequisites.

Feed-back from your fellow students in class discussion will improve your paper project. Readings for class discussion provide you with the knowledge you need as background for developing your research question. It is therefore vital that you engage actively in class discussion. You can only do this if you prepare the assigned readings, take reading notes, review your notes before class, and bring your notes with you to the class room. While they are not graded individually, your two-page review of Quelling the People in week two will feature into your discussion grade as well as the first two in-progress versions of your final paper in weeks five and seven. You will prepare and raise a discussion question once at the beginning of a class meeting. I encourage you to read during our nine weeks of classes a weekly magazine or a newspaper of your choice for reporting on civic activists, surveillance, censorship, or another aspect of authoritarian rule in China, for example the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Guardian. To shine in class discussion, you must be present. Absence, unless excused by medical reasons, and repeated late arrival to class will harm your grade. We are fallible and we all make mistakes, so you can miss one class meeting and be late once to class unexcused without consequences for your discussion grade. 35% For your mid-term exam in week four, I will give you at least three questions of which you will answer two in a total of 1,500 to 1,600 words. You will have five days for your answers. Write the combined, total word count on page one of your answers. Staple. Write your name on your answers. Insert page numbers. Submit your answers on time and on paper, or receive an F. 15% The final paper is the center-piece of this course. Why would internet videos be threatening to the powerful state? What alternative vision of China informs and animates activists' videos? How effective is a given video as a political weapon? How does the Chinese state portray your activists? What value judgments underlie the portrayals of your activists by Western reporters and professors? You will answer these questions for one or several Chinese videos subtitled in English (or any other language you happen to understand) that you find independently and that are not already assigned on the syllabus. You will search for English-language press coverage of the activists who made the videos as well as for scholarly articles or books on the activists. If you find nothing on your activists in the press nor in scholarship, you will relate your chosen activists and their initiatives to the scholarship we have read in class to see whether Western reporters and professors share activists' standards for evaluating life and politics in China. You will share two early, preliminary drafts of your paper with your classmates for feedback and meet with me one-on-one to discuss your writing. The last week is reserved for presenting your project in class. Submitting your paper late or in a way or format not specified on the syllabus will result in an F. 50%","The Chinese have achieved enormous economic growth over the last forty years which has dramatically raised living conditions in China. The Chinese Communist Party has steered this economic development through authoritarian rule which denies the Chinese liberties you take for granted. Thirty years ago, the Communist Party killed Chinese who demanded these liberties by employing the military inside the country. Since the massacre of 1989, protest in the streets has moved to networking on the internet. You will write your paper about this challenge to authoritarian rule by engaging some of the following questions: How have urban Chinese lived with the trauma of the massacre? What exactly happened thirty years ago? Making and uploading videos to the internet is a crucial weapon for activists. How do you evaluate the power of individual videos to force political change? These videos are documentaries, performance art, interviews, covert recordings of state agents, cries for help of fugitives in real time, and witness testimony. The creators of these videos are prepared to take risks because they feel there is something wrong with China today. These feelings are value judgments, or valuations. How do you tease out the values by which activists judge the state and evaluate their lives in China? What in turn are the value judgments of American reporters who report on Chinese activism to the American public? What are the value judgments of American professors who study Chinese activism? And what are your own value judgments: If it turns out that U.S. capitalism in its combination with democracy cannot economically compete with Chinese capitalism in its combination with authoritarian rule, and you were forced to choose, would you choose capitalism or democracy? What parts of your life would be impossible under authoritarian rule? Which line would populism and neo-authoritarianism in America have to cross for you to fight the government?"

Ahi?s? undergirds the modern concept of &quot;nonviolence,&quot; which refers to any spiritual, ethical, or political disposition that refuses to use violence in the navigation of daily life and/or in the resolution of conflict. The practice of nonviolence, by whatever name, is found in cultures around the globe and throughout history. Some people and communities feel a strong ethical or spiritual impulse toward nonviolence. For them, nonviolence is a matter of principle and may or may not also be seen as a tool for political change. For others, nonviolent strategies are ways to resolve social conflict at all levels. In the 20th century nonviolence came to be seen as a powerful force against repressive regimes. This course will examine critically the history, theory, and practice of nonviolence and assess its limitations and potential. We will look at the feasibility of nonviolence for our species through an inquiry into the connection between violence, nonviolence, and human nature. We will also examine at the role of spiritual and ethical conviction in the establishment of nonviolent dispositions and explore the uses and limits of nonviolence toward contemporary political ends."

In the lab, this organism has served as a model eukaryote to study basic principles genetics and development for over 80 years. Recent genomic studies have revealed that Schizophyllum harbors far more genetic variation than any other eukaryotic organism. In addition, because of the genetic variation at the two genetic loci that control mating, it is estimated that there are over 23,000 &quot;sexes&quot; in this fungus!

Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity.

This course will explore the ecology of plant-animal interactions. Through the survey of the scientific literature, we will investigate the consequences of mutualistic interactions (pollination and seed dispersal) and antagonistic interactions (herbivory and parasitism) for individual organisms, population dynamics, ecological communities, and entire ecosystems. Finally, we will learn how these various interactions are responding to global change, including habitat destruction and climate change."

The second Midterm during finals week is NOT cumulative. These will test proficiency through a combination of open questions in three categories: common knowledgebase, conceptual understanding, and complex problem solving skills. To do well on these tests, it is essential that students are able to make connections between disparate pieces knowledge/class content, and to apply knowledge to unfamiliar new contexts.","This class is an introductory level biochemistry course. It covers basic topics such as macromolecular structure and function of biologically relevant macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids), membrane structure, membrane transport, signal transduction, chemical logic in metabolic transformations, and carbohydrate metabolism. The course strongly emphasizes conceptual understanding, and offers extensive student-teacher interaction. Active participation in all course elements is encouraged and advantageous as students are expected to move past memorization of facts to a fully interconnected and integrated understanding that allows students to apply their knowledge to solve complex problems. This course will equip students preparing for the MCAT."

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors.<br/><br/>The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of:<br/><br/>Instrumental analysis<br/>Synthesis of inorganic compounds<br/>Synthesis of organic compounds<br/>Spectroscopy<br/><br/>The course is designed for you to work in a &quot;research environment&quot;. That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example:<br/>In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. <br/><br/>CHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements.

Tourists marvel at the size of the sites and empathize with the plight of the towns' inhabitants. However, Campania's destroyed cities have much more to offer than the familiar story of the 79 AD earthquake. Rather than presenting a static picture of Campania's towns as &quot;frozen in time,&quot; this course takes a diachronic approach to the rich archaeological material. <br/><br/>Campania was not originally Roman territory and was conquered by force of arms. Pompeii for instance, often presented as an archetypal Roman town, was not Roman at all for most of its existence. Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities were thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life. <br/><br/>This course will survey key aspects of the evidence, which will include a discussion of current archaeological techniques and fieldwork. The course will also discuss the 18th century uncovering of Campania's cities, which is a story in its own right. Contemporaries were sometimes shocked by what they found. But they also admired the ancient art, and the towns' rediscovery deeply influenced European artistic tastes. The course will include discussions of the impact that the discoveries had on the 18th and 19th century imagination."

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power and weakness. To what extent does seduction affirm an unequal gender logic? Does seduction always imply violence? This seminar aims to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction in a variety of literary, psychoanalytical, and philosophical texts. We will start by considering one of the central mythical figures of modernity, Don Juan, in Molière and Da Ponte's retellings of the story, where seduction takes the form of a gendered performance. Paying particular attention to the theoretical interventions of Shoshana Felman and Judith Butler, we will explore the imaginative links between gender, performance, and seduction.<br/><br/>Our reading of Choderlos de Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons will revolve around the question of how the narrative may be said to complicate or even reverse earlier cultural assumptions about gender and seduction. We then will investigate &quot;The Diary of a Seducer&quot; in Kierkegaard's Either/Or, which interprets seduction as the lynchpin between the aesthetic and the ethical, pleasure and the law. Finally, we will reflect in what ways the very history of psychoanalysis has been marked by the discovery of seduction?of a child by an adult?thus establishing a connection to trauma that Freud initially acknowledged and then denied. Through readings of essays by Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, and Masson, we will discuss how psychoanalysis has responded to the scandal of seduction by problematizing ethical, and normative solutions to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness and has regarded seduction as foundational in the development of the human subject. <br/><br/>Works by Molière, Laclos, Mueller, Kierkegaard, Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, Masson, Felman, and Butler.<br/><br/>Taught seminar style.

During the last 30 years, it has become a common point of reference for an array of disciplines that are concerned with scope, shape, and function of the different forms of violence associated with the modern nation state. In this class, we will carefully examine Benjamin's original text, explore its philosophical and literary context, become familiar with the major positions of the reception of the essay, and discuss its political relevance today.<br/>Reading might include, among others, authors such as Benjamin, Cohen, Kafka, Kant, Landauer, Sorel, Agamben, Derrida, Hamacher, Butler, and Menke."

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-Gómez, Rita Laura Segato, Verónica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a &quot;potencia feminista&quot; (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as &quot;zapatismo&quot; and its political principle of &quot;governing obeying&quot;?<br/><br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a &quot;knowledge dispositive&quot; (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to María Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-Góme, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."

There is thus not one Renaissance, and not just because the period itself was multiple There have been many Renaissances, and they have served different purposes in different cultural moments. The Renaissance has been asked to stand for the rise of science and the decline of faith; an upwelling and channeling of powerful, ancient forces; a point of resistance to industrialism, capitalism, and modernity; the very opening of modernity. Taking its cue from reception studies in Classics, this course will consider how the Renaissance as a cultural and historical phenomenon has been framed and reframed for various ideals in various eras. Case studies may include Italy in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the Renaissance declared itself a Renaissance of ancient culture; the 19th century, when historians like Burckhardt and Michelet and artists like William Morris, Ruskin, and the pre-Raphaelites imagined a Renaissance that opposed the industrialization that they saw marring Europe; the later 19th century, when Pater and Symonds used the Renaissance to explore sexual desires that their own culture did not sanction; and the early 20th century, when Warburg and Walter Benjamin imagined an apocalyptic Renaissance that shattered the linearity of history itself. Students will be asked to research another moment in the history of the reception of the Renaissance."

These decisions are especially interesting when there are several firms with interdependent payoffs; e.g., the choice of one firm to cut its price or close a retail store affects not only its profits, but also rival firms' profits. Inspired by both classical and modern readings about strategy, we develop and employ game theory tools to study firm behavior in a variety of scenarios, beginning with static (one period) models, and then turning to dynamic settings, in which firms may pursue profits through mergers, R&amp;D investments, or the timing of a product launch. We also explore pricing schemes as well as tactics managers might use to modify the business environment in ways that enhance their firms' long-run profits. E.g., a firm may try to drive rivals out of the market, keep potential rivals from entering the market, or cooperate with rivals - strategies that may dampen competitive forces and possibly run afoul of antitrust laws."

Students will understand the measurement of price level changes, labor market variables, productivity, and the macroeconomic imbalances that can exist with the government budget and for assets and trade flows between nations in world markets. Students will understand the monetary and financial systems and how they contributed to our current situation, both in the US and Europe. Students will also understand the determinants of long run economic growth, and the resulting implications."

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through price discrimination, resale price maintenance, entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law.

We take a broad approach to institutions and examine both formal institutions such as constitutions, law, and property rights and informal institutions as such customs, traditions, and codes of conducts. A key feature of these institutions is that they rarely change and crucially affect economic behavior. For instance, lack of clearly defined property rights reduces the ability to obtain credit, and a lack of trust reduces the willingness to engage in economic exchanges. We first focus on understanding better why a specific set of institutions emerged and which sets of institutions have fostered economic development historically. We then discuss the importance of the persistence of institutions for current differences in economic development and economic growth.

We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer's life, said it simply: &quot;You have to be obsessed. It's not something you'd want to be?it's rather something you couldn't help but be.&quot; In this course we'll explore &quot;obsession&quot; from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we'll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to?from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind's eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we'll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.<br/><br/>Students will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story.

Our course will explore the various literary and popular representations of these sins, their transformation from the medieval to modern period, and the possible virtues they generated along the way. We will survey how medieval writers and thinkers first taught the Seven Deadly Sins and their corresponding virtues, while questioning whether these lessons have persisted in our present era. By reading translations of some medieval works, such as bawdy Old French comic tales and epic Middle English dream visions, along with modern authors ranging from Roald Dahl to Jeffrey Eugenides, we will explore the creative ways these vices and virtues have interacted with each other across media, cultures and ages. Our goal is not simply to understand how or why these particular qualities have captured our imaginations for centuries: we will also examine the methods writers used to ensure that their version of the vices and virtues would endure. In doing so, we will ask critical questions about ethics, religion, gender and history, all the while becoming more savvy and astute close-readers of our world today."

Accompanied by accelerations in global heating, unpredictable seasonal cycles, and political inaction, it has become increasingly clear that not only how weather is spoken about but also the weather events themselves are deeply political. In this freshman seminar, we will consider a variety of contemporary representations of weather from art to fiction to poetry and film to explore the relationship between weather as material event and weather as political context. Where does weather begin and end? What happens when weather becomes not just a mysterious force but an actively produced by-product of industrial expansion?

Dick, dystopian fiction is currently having an influential moment. This course will explore the current fascination with dystopia, especially as the form relates to modes of political debate. How do dystopias produce their own argumentation in the form of narrative? How have they spurred debate in different historical moments? How well do political arguments and media adaptations based on dystopian fiction represent their source material, and why might that matter?

While this proves a handy mnemonic device, it also presents a distant view of the Great Lakes Basin that begs the question: what does it mean to make home here? Who lives here, and what kinds of &quot;homes&quot; have they built? In this seminar, we will challenge ourselves to rethink the physical and social geographies surrounding the Great Lakes by reading works that complicate &quot;official&quot; mappings of this region with more local, experiential accounts of place. We will look closely at how various texts and objects (from short stories, hymns, and a dystopian novel to monuments, maps, and birch bark) emerge out of specific places in the Great Lakes Basin and remap those places by disrupting broader national narratives that erase their particularities. Starting on Lake Michigan's shores and moving outward to the rapids of Niagara Falls, Lake Superior's stunning Pictured Rocks, and even a post-apocalyptic Ontario, our explorations of place will engage with a range of questions: What happens when we view Chicago and its waterways as Native space? What forms of communal homemaking are reflected by the ships, canoes, buildings, neighborhoods, and cities in and around the Great Lakes? How do lake ecosystems relate to global climate change? Along the way, students will experiment with place-based digital tools (such as StoryMap software and the Native Land territories app) and will have the opportunity to research a place that captures their interest."

Le Guin's dragon-infested Earthsea or the extra-terrestrial planet of Octavia Butler's &quot;Bloodchild&quot; (1984).

Thus, sociolinguistic diversity?differences across and within spoken and written languages and dialects?is inevitable. This seminar will explore the ways in which language difference is situated in current discourses, considering language in written, spoken, and signed forms. We will disrupt monolingual ideologies that infiltrate those discourses, focusing on the ways in which difference in language is an asset to individuals, cultures, and institutions. The course will consider how our sociolinguistic diversity sustains us, how we can sustain sociolinguistic diversity, and how we can create more equity and inclusion around language differences in a variety of social contexts. Students will formulate and consider their own questions about sociolinguistic diversity, equity, and inclusion in papers and presentations.

The course will introduce the plays by introducing them back into the context of the theatre, literary world, and culture in which Shakespeare originally wrote them. We will think about Shakespeare's contexts and how they matter: a theatre on the outskirts of ever-expanding Renaissance London; a financially successful acting company in which he played the simultaneous and often overlapping roles of writer, actor, and co-owner; a world of reading and writing in which words, plots, and texts were constantly being re-circulated into new plays; the rich possibilities of the English language around 1600. We will centrally consider the ways in which these theatrical, literary, and cultural questions register within the plays themselves. What do words, plays, stories do?how do they work?in Shakespeare's plays? Who or what is an audience or an actor in these plays? How do Shakespeare's plays stage issues such as gender, race, religion, sexuality, social class, entertainment and the media - and how does his approach to these issues continue to speak to our own era?"

The primary genre under discussion in this course will be the personal essay, but students will be free to write in other genres. We will approach the essay as a record of the movement of the author's mind over her subject, a process aided and augmented by research. Research takes many forms in the personal essay, from informal conversations to meandering walks to the consultation of archival documents and photographs. Accordingly, our working definition of research will be expansive, and students will be encouraged to engage in research that is not text-based. Readings will be drawn from a broad range of contemporary nonfiction as well as some poetry.

How are we moving beyond the &quot;recording&quot; of experience, which is essentially a passive form of writing (regardless of the content of the experience and the individual value that we bring to it) to the idea of &quot;using experience as the template for an intervention of inquiry,&quot; itself a much more active approach? How to translate the much-needed theoretical positions that undergird our work into poems that transcend them?<br/><br/>Students will select a photographer or other visual artist whose work they think shares the same core aesthetic as theirs (and no it cannot be another writer), pick a series from that artists work (no more than 5 (five) paintings, photographs or any other &quot;forms&quot;) and write a short one page explanation speaking to why this artist, this work and this sequence. Then students MUST submit a sequence of 15 pages of poetry assembled as an arc (the typical chapbook is 25-30 pages of poetry, so this is less than that). The poems will be placed in a manuscript style format with a title page etc. The two items (artist selection and poems) will be submitted on the first day of class so that we can begin work almost immediately.

Early modern playwrights were especially fascinated by the power that people could accrue through the world of business and commerce. In this course, we will consider key works by Shakespeare that explore the possibilities offered by the market, alongside plays by his contemporaries that celebrate and satirize the pursuit of profit. We will read specific plays for how much fun, and potentially dangerous, they consider the hunt for wealth and power to be, including: Shakespeare's exploration of political power, justice, and debt in The Merchant of Venice; Ben Jonson's satire of the alchemical desire to turn lead to gold in The Alchemist; and Thomas Middleton's Ocean's 11-style con-game in Michaelmas Term. By analysing major works of early modern drama, written just as the West was witnessing the emergence of capitalism and the modern economy, we will gain a deeper understanding of how writers were representing and questioning the basic assumptions of their culture about the role that commerce could or should have in their lives."

Despite their obvious ideological differences, both are instances of medievalism, defined as the &quot;adoption of, adherence to, or interest in medieval ideals, styles, or usages&quot; in the modern world. Indeed, both draw on the same conception of the Middle Ages as the so-called &quot;Age of Chivalry,&quot; with its values of courage, faithfulness, and fighting ability, centered on the masculine and aristocratic figure of the knight. In this course we will examine this and other conceptions of the Middle Ages, including the &quot;Dark Ages,&quot; the &quot;Site of Origin,&quot; and &quot;The Mirror of Post-Modernity,&quot; investigating the modern uses and abuses associated with each. As we do, you will learn how to identify and narrow a research topic, navigate electronic databases, identify and evaluate pertinent critical articles, and produce article abstracts, an annotated bibliography, and a project proposal. The course will culminate in a 12-15 page research paper that investigates a single instance of medievalism, analyzing the ways it seeks to use the Middle Ages to change the modern world. Broadly defined research areas might include, but are not limited to, romantic medievalism, the relationship between medievalism and nationalism, the role of medievalism in international relations, medievalism in role-playing and online gaming, and queer and trans medievalisms."

Ever since Aristotle's promised account of comedy, written to follow his famous discussion of tragedy in Poetics, accidentally got lost, comedy has suffered from genre confusion in the shadow of its allegedly more serious double, tragedy. On the one hand, the source of comedy's appeal seems to go without saying. On the other, maybe for that very reason, comedy has rarely gotten the same kind of serious attention as other forms of writing and performance, and some of its sharpest theorists are also its greatest creators. Is it the same as what is funny? Is it just a happy ending? What is happiness, anyway? Who knows? This two-thousand-year indecision makes comedy an ideal topic for a course to explore tactics of reading and interpretation. We will read comedies from Aristophanes to modern sit comes, and weigh against them some of comedy's theories, including formal, historical, social, anthropological, and psychological approaches."

Having a harmful moral lesson? Being poorly written? Once we decide a book is bad, what should we do with it? Is official censorship the answer? Should publishers be boycotted? How should we decide what is acceptable to teach in a classroom setting?and to what extent should this depend on the age of the students? These questions have been argued over since Plato declared that the poets should be excluded from his utopian city. They are no less pressing in our own day, when commitments to free speech run up against anger at harmful racial and other stereotypes in literature. In this course, you will have to opportunity to examine arguments about what constitutes &quot;bad&quot; literature from a range of historical and cultural contexts. Even as you read and analyze arguments about the literary and moral value of particular books, you will have to the opportunity to construct your own arguments in response and grapple with the real difficulties that books can present?especially when they clash with values that we ourselves hold dear."

Brief weekly responses and one longer final paper.,"This course will take as fundamental that black vernacular?the dialects and slang and folk language found in black communities?is a form of theory and theorizing. This theory, though different from the capital-T Theory of notable philosophers, will be shown to also possess intellectual sophistication, simply in, as Barbara Christian has said, &quot;the form of the hieroglyph.&quot; If we assume, rightly, that black people have always theorized, only in different and alternative ways, how might we examine the nuances of that theory? What does it look like? Where, and it what forms, can it be found?<br/><br/>&quot;Black Vernacular as Theory&quot; will traverse myriad discursive genres?from novels to poems to music to social media to personal lives. It will put, say, the conversations between black women in the kitchen on par with the intellectual status of literary theorists, dismantling implicit hierarchies between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; theory. Students will read the work of Barbara Christian, Geneva Smirtherman, Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, and others; listen to the corpus of Kendrick Lamar and Big L; and reflect on community conversations from family reunions and barbershops. Ultimately, we will begin to rethink what &quot;counts&quot; as theory, and how we might come to understand various marginalized communities within black cultural production as doing substantive work in terms of knowledge production."

There is thus not one Renaissance, and not just because the period itself was multiple There have been many Renaissances, and they have served different purposes in different cultural moments. The Renaissance has been asked to stand for the rise of science and the decline of faith; an upwelling and channeling of powerful, ancient forces; a point of resistance to industrialism, capitalism, and modernity; the very opening of modernity. Taking its cue from reception studies in Classics, this course will consider how the Renaissance as a cultural and historical phenomenon has been framed and reframed for various ideals in various eras. Case studies may include Italy in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the Renaissance declared itself a Renaissance of ancient culture; the 19th century, when historians like Burckhardt and Michelet and artists like William Morris, Ruskin, and the pre-Raphaelites imagined a Renaissance that opposed the industrialization that they saw marring Europe; the later 19th century, when Pater and Symonds used the Renaissance to explore sexual desires that their own culture did not sanction; and the early 20th century, when Warburg and Walter Benjamin imagined an apocalyptic Renaissance that shattered the linearity of history itself. Students will be asked to research another moment in the history of the reception of the Renaissance."

How is black insecurity distinct from insecurity broadly conceived? What unique qualities does literature have that help critics understand black insecurity in ways other forms can't? This class will examine essays, poetry, and fiction written in the post-soul era?that is written between the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act?to examine the ongoing struggle for black freedom and the conditions of insecurity that underwrite it. We will specifically examine the relationship between insecurity as an affect, and the periodization of post-soul writing, asking specific questions about the unfulfilled promises of Civil Rights era agitation and the ongoing insecurities that suffuse discourses of black activism, especially those related to police and vigilante violence of the last decade. We relate these forms of antiblack violence to the ongoing War on Terror to assess their interdependence. We will also interrogate how progressive calls for various kinds of security from food security to climate security reinforce the discourse of security."

Taking Fanon's polemic as a cue, this graduate seminar will look at a number of late twentieth-century textual and performance sites with radical instances of experimentation where articulations of blackness move into the interstitial space between meaning and non-meaning, coming into being precisely at the moment when the compositional logic of their anticipated forms are ruptured. The course will focus on three primary sites where black artists engage what might be called the poetics of dissolution to examine and critique the processes of racial formation: poetry (where the form of the line or stanza dissolves); music (where sonic interpolations put additional, if not different, claims on the lyrical content), and visual culture (where moves toward graphic mimesis are refused delineation). The material under consideration will include work by the poets Nathaniel Mackey and Harriet Mullen; turntablists DJ Spooky, Jazzy Jeff, and Premier; songs by musicians from Ella Fitzgerald to Rahzel; and pieces by visual artists Kara Walker and Glenn Ligon.

What is the role of literature and the environmental humanities in addressing ecological questions in the Global South? How well have postcolonial artists used avantgarde aesthetics to respond to ecological disasters? How does ecology intersect with other social justice questions (race, gender, sexuality, etc.) through form in postcolonial literary texts? What do the texts tell us about human-animal entanglements? As we respond to these questions, we will explore and critique ideas on postcolonial ecocritical thought (e.g., work by Elizabeth Deloughrey, Amitav Ghosh, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Rob Nixon, Cajetan Iheka, and Byron Caminero-Santangelo).

Beginning with its 19th century origins in gothic fiction and adventure narratives, we will trace the development of science fiction through its early 20th century boom as a pulp form, its mid-century emergence as a recognizable literary genre, and its late 20th century adoption as a venue for exploring identity politics. How have longstanding genre themes like technological innovation and futuristic social progress endured or changed over time? How have explorations of race, gender, and sexuality been important to the genre's development? How has sci-fi shaped the wider social world in realms like scientific research, political rhetoric, fan cultures, and popular media?

In this course, we will ponder the entertainment value of certain potent combinations of romance and riches, as these are presented through the lives of literature's best known and most complex characters. Characters such as Shakespeare's Shylock, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and Kevin Kwan's extravagant Singaporeans, confront us with fascinating questions about erotic desire and wealth that play upon our hopes and fears: how do we know if we love someone for themselves or for their money? What is the difference between a romantic and financial bond? What does it mean to experience passion through the filter of financial language and metaphors? Can we really have it all??? As we consider the relationship in these texts between romance and riches, jealousy and insolvency, we will challenge our basic assumptions about what it means to be in love, in debt, flush with money, and trapped in poverty."

To this end, we will read literature and watch films that address Hollywood filmmaking, connections between &quot;the American Dream&quot; and celebrity status, the relationship between stars and their fans, the consequences of intense media scrutiny, and the racial and gendered structures that shape fame. Recognizing that the divisions between celebrity culture, politics, and other media forms have long been blurred, this course will also prompt students to delve into the dark sides of American culture, asking questions about our obsessions with crime, corruption, and Hollywood glamour."

In this course, you will experience the poetry of the three Abrahamic religions?Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?as it wrestles with these darker emotions. The resources of poetic language allow space for ambiguity and doubt to coexist with hope and faith; the tools that poets use to craft emotion can powerfully explore conflict and resolution. You will have the opportunity to sample from a wide variety of poetic genres, from the verse of the ancient world to contemporary American rap.

We'll start by reading examples of medieval saints' lives alongside the 1988 film Stand and Deliver, starring Edward James Olmos as a self-sacrificing high school math teacher. We'll then go on to read different medieval versions of the Robin Hood legend in conjunction with a series of Robin Hood films, starting with the 1922 silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks (we will probably skip the critically-panned 2018 remake, unless someone can make the case that its shortcomings are interestingly symptomatic). We'll consider the ways authors and directors reimagine the legend for different historical moments, including as a context for examining categories such as heroism, masculinity and femininity, and the relationship between law and violence. Finally, our study of King Arthur and the Round Table will pair the anonymous La Mort le Roi Artu with Robert Bresson's award-winning Lancelot du Lac (1974). In what ways do the modern retellings of these medieval tales give us new insight into the tales themselves? In what ways does the reconstruction of the Middle Ages serve purely modern ends? What kinds of different &quot;Middle Ages&quot; do these texts and their retellings imagine? In addition to this comparative work, we will pay attention to the films as films and to the medieval works as both oral performances and textual objects in order to think about the relationship between medium and message."

Where the twenty-first century has produced new forms like the Instagram poem and the Twitter saga, the sixteenth century saw the rise of the printed anthology, shape poems, and commercial playtexts. With the introduction of the printing press, the rise of literacy, and the invention of the commercial theater, more people were exposed to a greater range of writing than ever before. This explosion of printed texts led both to fresh avenues of creativity?women writing for print, ordinary people building their own custom volumes? and new challenges, including censorship and piracy. As we read the writing of the age of Shakespeare as it appeared when it was first printed, we will think about what difficulties and opportunities for creativity face us as we travel farther into our own digital age, as how we encounter texts changes once again."

While tracking the sequence and dialogue of a handful of key critical paradigms from the last half century (and more), we will investigate how lyric poetry situates its reader in a universe of discourse through rhetorical address, affective cues, and social disposition. The &quot;environments&quot; in question thus connote familiar Romantic scholarship on &quot;nature poetry,&quot; and the relations of language to nature; but we will do so always bearing in mind that for the Romantics, natural environments implicate social and psychic geographies as well. Relevant critical work will be drawn from intersections of phenomenology, theories of voice, sound ecologies, social theory, and linguistic anthropology. We end the course with a handful of works by living poets that distinctively (and sometimes self-consciously) reconfigure the conventions of romantic lyric. Poets include Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Samuel Coleridge, Anna Barbauld, John Clare, Percy Shelley, Felicia Hemans and John Keats (depending on student interest, this list may extend farther forward into the C19); contemporary poets: Claudia Rankine, Ed Roberson, Tommy Pico, Lisa Robertson and Daniel Borzutzky."

We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get."

The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry?including description, rhetoric, story and song?and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and &quot;imitation&quot; assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of &quot;Daily Poems,&quot; thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing."

Using Lord's A Giacometti Portrait as a jumping-off point for discussion, we'll examine works of fiction, nonfiction and poetry that have resulted from the close study of a single subject-a person, a group of people, a place, an object, an experience, or a physical sensation. We'll also examine how the assigned texts blur the borders between observer and observed. And finally, we'll conclude the course with a close examination of the self, with participants probing the events and experiences that formed them as writers and offering an in-depth exploration of their own artistic challenges and goals. In addition to A Giacometti Portrait, we'll read works by Virginia Woolf, Jamaica Kincaid, Rachel Cusk, Mark Doty and Wis?awa Szymborska, among many other authors."

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a &quot;global consciousness&quot; and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and technoscience to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;species&quot; are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament.<br/><br/>Open to students in Environmental Policy and Culture during Pre-registration"

Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic &quot;green&quot; messaging versus mere corporate &quot;greenwashing.&quot; Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the &quot;Anthropocene&quot; (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually &quot;register&quot; or &quot;notice&quot; on a global scale? If not, what kinds of &quot;media interventions&quot; do we need to be making and how? Course content will include discussion of media interventions as moral interventions, media directed at social change, eco-media responses by religious communities and organizations, participatory digital culture, and the challenges of addressing environmental crisis in the distraction economy and what has been called the &quot;post-truth era.&quot; Students will have the opportunity to propose and craft their own environmental media interventions as the course's final project.<br/><br/>No prerequisites. *This course is for undergraduate students only and not for graduate students."

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power and weakness. To what extent does seduction affirm an unequal gender logic? Does seduction always imply violence? This seminar aims to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction in a variety of literary, psychoanalytical, and philosophical texts. We will start by considering one of the central mythical figures of modernity, Don Juan, in Molière and Da Ponte's retellings of the story, where seduction takes the form of a gendered performance. Paying particular attention to the theoretical interventions of Shoshana Felman and Judith Butler, we will explore the imaginative links between gender, performance, and seduction.<br/><br/>Our reading of Choderlos de Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons will revolve around the question of how the narrative may be said to complicate or even reverse earlier cultural assumptions about gender and seduction. We then will investigate &quot;The Diary of a Seducer&quot; in Kierkegaard's Either/Or, which interprets seduction as the lynchpin between the aesthetic and the ethical, pleasure and the law. Finally, we will reflect in what ways the very history of psychoanalysis has been marked by the discovery of seduction?of a child by an adult?thus establishing a connection to trauma that Freud initially acknowledged and then denied. Through readings of essays by Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, and Masson, we will discuss how psychoanalysis has responded to the scandal of seduction by problematizing ethical, and normative solutions to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness and has regarded seduction as foundational in the development of the human subject."

We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the people's behaviors and responses during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded to the Nazi onslaught in ways similar and divergent. Sexism was also an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-Gómez, Rita Laura Segato, Verónica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a &quot;potencia feminista&quot; (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as &quot;zapatismo&quot; and its political principle of &quot;governing obeying&quot;?<br/><br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a &quot;knowledge dispositive&quot; (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to María Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-Góme, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."

Contemporary singing style is coveted and far reaching. But most students have been taught to sing (if at all) in a choral, classical model. This class will make everyone involved better singers regardless of aptitude. But it will also reveal and experiment with the de-mystification of singing popular music in both technique and style. To survive and excel in today's performance industry, actors need to be increasingly multifaceted. Singing is becoming a necessary skill set, not only for those actors interested in Musical Theatre, but for those actors who do not consider themselves able to carry a tune. Integrative theatre such as Goodman's A Christmas Carol, Mary Zimmerman's A Jungle Book, Once, The History Boys, etc. all require singing of their actors. However, singing is often times intimidating to those who haven't been raised with formal training. Non-actors find themselves in situations where singing is inescapable as well. The onslaught of singing-driven reality TV (American Idol, The X Factor, The Sing off, The Voice) has revived the Karaoke sensation. Musicians in pits and orchestras are finding voice to be an integral part of new compositions. Due to budget cuts and the movement of Arts Integration, elementary school educators are incorporating music into the general classroom curriculum, and the singing voice will necessarily become the instrument of choice, since every child has one, and instruments remain expensive to purchase. For the painters, sculpters, and arts aficionados, well &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; is sung around dinner tables on a regular basis, and children will always want a lullaby sung to them at bedtime. There are ways to feel comfortable, confident, and competent while singing without years of training. This course will REVIEW and SOLIDIFY singing fundamentals, vocal health, and then delve into contemporary singing styles."

Almost 80 years after his death, Freud's legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer and gender studies, communications, and many more. What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time. This class will read fundamental texts from Freud's body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud's near and distant predecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the many different kinds of questions that Freud's work addresses."

While Aristotle's contributions to the theory of tragedy in his Poetics are widely recognized, the field of comedy is - apart from some passing remarks - missing from this foundational work of aesthetics. Recently Giorgio Agamben defined his philosophy as a process of &quot;Taking Leave of Tragedy,&quot; thereby returning to Aristotle's lost origin. The idea of comedy represents a poetic mode of reflection which offers - in Agamben's view - a liberation from concepts of history and politics based on human suffering and guilt. While tragedy leads from a happy beginning to a catastrophic end, comedy reverses this schema and ends with the restoration of happiness.<br/>This class will trace this taking leave from a tragic paradigm in philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics by focusing on the notion of comedy. We will discuss the anti-tragic turn by bringing into conversation the poetological discourse on the relation of tragedy and comedy (from Aristotle to Hegel, Benjamin, and Agamben among others) with close readings of several comedies from the canon of European literature (Aristophanes, Calderon, Kleist, Tieck, Nestroy, Jarry, Hofmannsthal among others). How would a (post)-modern comedy look like, capable of overcoming a purely tragic view of modernity?

How have expressions of political authority and national belonging changed with global shifts from sovereign imperial polities to sovereign nation-states carved out of former empires? And how do shifts in state authority shape notions of belonging among imperial subjects and national citizens inhabiting frontier territories? This seminar is an opportunity to reflect on these complex and topical questions. We will adopt a historical and comparative approach to analyze frontier regions spread across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and North America. In doing so, we will take border regions and peoples seriously, instead of dismissing them as ?peripheries' of various imperial and national states. We will learn the stories of communities that inhabit such regions as they moved from imperial subjecthood to national citizenship?a process that happened more than once for some of them. Putting these stories in conversation with inherited cultural and scholarly knowledge about nationalism, we will discover what makes a region a borderland, and the extent to which frontiers are central to the formation and perpetuation of sovereign states. <br/><br/>This seminar is divided into three parts.

Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate &quot;German&quot; women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism."

Jews, for their part, composed a host of polemical works that lambasted Christians for their purported idolatry, stupidity, and savagery. Yet today, Jews and Christians are commonly believed to be joint participants in an idyllic &quot;Judeo-Christian tradition.&quot; This course will attempt to grapple with the disparity between these overarching views by exploring the varying, nuanced ways in which Jews and Christians have related to and perceived of one another, from the Biblical period to the present. We will examine textual, artistic, and cinematic sources, and investigate some of the theological, social, and cultural dynamics that have shaped Jewish-Christian relations over a wide geographical and chronological expanse."

The course follows chronological developments in two major regions of East Africa: the Great Lakes region and the Indian Ocean coast. No previous knowledge of African history is required. The course will familiarize you with non-traditional sources for history?archaeology, environment and ecology, historical linguistics, and oral traditions?in addition to more conventional, textual sources. It will explore the rise and significance of agriculture in the region; depict the shifting historical relationships between health, wealth, political culture, and social identity; examine the growth of states in parts of eastern Africa; explore the history of slavery; and engage Eastern Africans' cosmopolitan aspirations that influenced wider worlds."

We will study the development and implementation of a range of ideologies, including nationalism, liberalism, capitalism, communism, imperialism, and fascism/Nazism. At the beginning of the period, hereditary monarchs and nobles ruled over illiterate peasants throughout most of the continent; two and a half centuries later most Europeans live under democratically elected governments that guarantee universal health care, social security, and a relatively high standard of living. The transformation of the continent was far, however, from an unending or inexorable story of progress. In the intervening centuries national states supplanted diverse empires and forcibly assimilated or violently purged ethnic minorities. The European powers conquered most of the world and reluctantly relinquished it only after the devastation of two world wars and bitter struggles for decolonization. In the wake of Nazi Germany's defeat, Europeans embarked on an unprecedented and remarkably successful project of economic and political unification that over the past decade has confronted economic crises, divisions over mass migration, and the rise of new authoritarian movements. From the monarchial empires of the eighteenth century to the European Union of the twenty-first, this course will trace the political, social, cultural, and economic transformation of the continent."

While debates over the value and dangers of the concept look back to the Greeks, the prescriptive claims of our century take for granted the institutional, technological, political, spatial, and communicative developments associated with the rise of public cultures since the eighteenth-century. Historians in this conversation tend to focus on the processes of contact (between cultures, goods, and peoples) with an acute attention to power. For Europeanists in particular, modern cosmopolitanism has lived in the shadows of imperialism and the nation-state. Hence, while sharing the aspirations of cosmopolitan ideals, historical research typically introduces skeptical caution. This seminar will bring together the historical research that have both directly and indirectly this question in critical conversations with philosophers and political theorists of the new cosmopolitanism like David Held, Martha Nussbaum, Kwame Anthony Appiah. Some historical themes to be examined include: capitalist connoisseurship, worldly citizenship in revolutionary transformations, anthropological knowledge, the technological and commercial developments of mass information and entertainment, searches for colonial exoticism/erotic diversity/sexual dissidence in metropolitan cities, diasporic displacements and de-colonization."

A History of Northwestern and Evanston<br/><br/>This course will provide students with a way to explore the history of Northwestern University and Evanston, IL. Often when students and faculty arrive at a campus, they think very little about how the campus came to be. Who lived on the land before the university existed? What were the goals of the university at its founding? How did the university relate to the town within which it exists? How has the university changed over time, and how does that reflect changes in higher education-in the case of Northwestern, from the Pre-Civil War period to the present? For whom were universities created, and who do universities serve today? When and why did it become important for non-elite people to attain a college degree? This course will provide students with a way to think about these topics generally, and within the specific context of Northwestern and Evanston.<br/><br/>In addition, students will learn about archives-one of the sources of raw material from which history is created. In addition to the University archives available at Northwestern, students will visit the Evanston Historical Society and Northshore, a community archive. Students will also do a campus tour; and a tour of the town of Evanston. These experiences will give students a sense of public history: how historical narratives are shaped by institutions for the general public. Some of these tours may take place on Saturdays early in the quarter.<br/><br/>By the end of the course, students will have gained a deeper sense of the history of the place within which they will spend a large portion of the next four years. This history continues to influence Northwestern and Evanston today. By understanding this history, students can think about the challenges and possibilities for their own time here. What histories do you wish to create at Northwestern and in Evanston?"

The material objects studied will engage with key themes of the pre-modern world including: religion, trade, travel, domestic environments, intellectual culture, medicine, and working life. Through the use of a wide range of primary sources, and secondary background readings, the aim of this course is to understand how material objects are historical sources, and how they can shape and transform cultures."

A definition of violence may seem obvious?violence is bodily harm and its aftermaths wrought by one or more persons against one more others. But that simple definition masks moral struggles over questions of the legitimacy of violence. Because thinking historically about violence involves the sometimes overlapping, perspectives of perpetrators, victims, and witnesses, explaining its causes and consequences must address historically specific dimensions of motive and constraint. This approach to violence opens up the ways in which struggles over the morality and legitimacy of force shaped forms of violence in African history. We'll work our way toward asking better questions about the causes and consequences of the violence at the core of slavery and slave trading in West Africa, imperial conquest and colonial power in East Africa, and genocide in Rwanda."

His first book, Cuauhtémoc's Bones: Forging National Identity in Modern Mexico was based on his undergraduate honours thesis; it was awarded the Conference on Latin American History's Mexican history prize, and an Honourable Mention in the Latin American Studies Assocation's similar category. Inspired by his Mexican friends' queries as to why he studied forging peasants, and how did he manage to get paid for such an obvious swindle, anyway, Gillingham turned to a more political history for his subsequent work. This resulted in Unrevolutionary Mexico: The Birth of a Strange Dictatorship, forthcoming with Yale in 2020, and two edited volumes: Dictablanda: Politics, Work, and Culture in Mexico, 1938-1968 and Journalism, Satire and Censorship in Modern Mexico.

Within this chronological framework, the course will explore such topics as nationalism, the changing status of Chinese women, the power of revolutionary charisma, and the place of the Patriotic Democratic Movement of 1989 in China's long tradition of student and labor protest.

Over the course of the modern period, science has earned widespread authority as ?objective' knowledge about the natural world. Yet as most scientists today will freely admit, decisions about which research questions earn attention (and funding) and how research is carried out are influenced by powerful institutions, political considerations, business interests, technological changes, imperialism, and societal expectations. Science is, after all, a human activity. With this lesson in mind, our course surveys the history of science from the Enlightenment until the Cold War, in a series of overlapping units examining medicine, physics, biology, and earth sciences. We will be guided by questions including: What counted as ?science' in different times and places? How did scientific researchers earn a living, and which institutions supported them, or didn't? Above all, what changing values has science reflected over the course of the modern period?"

What are the historical origins of South Asian diasporic communities in Africa, South-east Asia, Europe, and North America? How did South Asia's encounter with colonialism affect the migration of South Asians elsewhere? In this thematic survey, we will learn about the history of South Asians' migration from the nineteenth century to the present, with special emphasis on the historical inter-relatedness of migration, colonialism, and decolonization. Our cast of characters will range from soldiers and exiles to laborers and merchants. We will traverse a diverse array of geographies, ranging from Singapore and Fiji to Uganda and Britain. We will discover how South Asian communities in various parts of the world were made and unmade by colonial economic imperatives, often exploitative trans-oceanic labor networks, and colonial categories of social identification. Instead of being erased by mid-twentieth century decolonization, South Asians' migration was reshaped by national imperatives of the ?home' country on the one hand, and the new political and economic order of the post-World War II world on the other. <br/><br/>The course is divided into two parts. In Part I, we walk through the history of South Asian migration, paying attention to the changing historical contexts and causes of this phenomenon. In Part II, we dive deeper into socio-religious characteristics of South Asian migrants, such as caste hierarchies and gender relations, and examine why these features have persisted, and been reinvented in some instances, despite centuries of habitation outside South Asia."

The goal of this course is to give students the opportunity to gain wider theoretical and empirical knowledge about several genocides that took place in different parts of the world (North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia), focusing mostly on the twentieth century cases of the Herero Genocide, the Holocaust, and Cambodia. The course will also examine the precursors of twentieth century genocides, by focusing on the destruction of Native Americans during the centuries of European colonization, which remains an under-researched and much debated topic, with major implications for today's American society. For decades, the Holocaust and the terror of the Khmer Rouge regime (Cambodia) have represented examples of mass atrocity that have affected millions of innocent civilians, with the aim of eliminating groups of people in whole or in part. The first genocide of the twentieth century, the destruction of the Herrero and Nama (in present-day Namibia) by the German Imperial Army is a lesser known case of genocide - it was almost forgotten until the boom in mass violence research in the 1990s - and yet crucially important to understand the ways in which the colonial driven destruction of indigenous people continued into the twentieth century and how it influenced the emergence of the Holocaust. <br/>In order to provide in-depth explanations and increase knowledge about the character of genocide, one therefore needs to place specific events in their proper historical, cultural, social, political, ideological and other contexts. After completing the course students will acquire solid knowledge about several cases of genocide, with a particular focus on the colonization processes, the growth of nationalist, racist, fascist and communist ideologies during the twentieth century, and the contemporary debates on comparing genocides, denial, and prevention."

Courts throughout the continent tried and punished hundreds of thousands for having worked with and for Germany and the Axis powers. By and large, however, those trials concentrated on crimes of political collaboration and paid little attention to what is now accepted as the Nazis' greatest crime: the genocide of European Jewry. Although courts did punish some architects of the so-called Final Solution, thousands of Europeans who had organized, perpetrated or otherwise contributed to the Holocaust escaped with minimal penalties or no punishment at all. Over the subsequent decades individuals, organizations, and states have sought to redress the failure to seek out and punish those perpetrators at war's end. Lawyers have prosecuted and defended accused war criminals before courts. Historians have documented the development and execution of genocide, while others have sought to deny the very murders themselves. Through the examination of a series of trials, the first half of the course will discuss both the struggle to bring perpetrators to justice and the efforts to obscure the crimes that had been committed. We will consider the prosecution of war crimes and genocide in the context of the development of international law and historical knowledge over the decades from the Second World War to the present day. For the second half of the course students will concentrate on individual research papers based on primary sources (for example, the records of the Nuremberg Tribunal or Eichman Trial)."

These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society. Microhistory is a method of investigation that usually relies on the evidence from judicial trials of otherwise obscure people who found themselves in trouble with the authorities. The method gives a voice to those who otherwise left no written record of their lives. The result of the studies has been a remarkable re-evaluation of the experiences and beliefs of the common people of pre-modern Europe."

But as many have argued recently, scholars invested in &quot;thinking big&quot; about history sometimes have difficulty addressing people who did not move across political boundaries, and they have typically neglected small, ordinary stories and domestic spaces. Since these have been the traditional interests of women's historians, the fields of global and women's history often seem irreconcilable, especially in the era before the twentieth century. One possible solution to this impasse is to deploy the analytical category of gender, which should be able to speak to both fields and across long spans of time. How have historians done this? What does gender history look like on a global scale? In this seminar, we will consider these questions, reading recent work that combines global and gender history in the early modern and modern eras."

We will also consider common representations?and misrepresentations-of varying women's urban lives. <br/> <br/>American women live in cities, work in cities, but have had to wage a fight that is by no means over to be accommodated in the urban world. From hostile built environments (e.g., lack of sufficient public women's bathrooms), ongoing lower salaries than men's, to the lack of subsidized childcare, to omnipresent harassment and sexual violence at work, at home, and in the public world, American cities are far more challenging environments for women than for men.<br/> <br/>We are living in a strange new cultural and political-economic arena, in which daily horrific racist/misogynist attacks and policies, from the White House down, jostle up against vibrant, active backlash and organizing by grassroots and other feminist and antiracist movements. I encourage students who are interested in unpacking the present to choose some element of the current national conjuncture and gender to research as your topic."
WCAS,HUM 370-3-21 Special Topics in the Humanities,"Earth Politics and Poetics: Knowing, Shaping, Imag",MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM,160,Locy Hall 314,[],,"Earth Politics and Poetics: Knowing, Shaping, and Imagining the Planet <br/><br/>&quot;Planet Earth&quot; has a political and social history. The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a &quot;global consciousness&quot; and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and technoscience to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;species&quot; are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament."

Archaeology offers nationalist agendas the possibility of filling in national historical records and extending the past far into prehistory. Its results can be displayed in museums, occupy entire sites, and be readily accessible online ?thus potentially reaching many new audiences beyond traditional print media. In turn, nationalism has contributed significantly to the development of archaeology as a modern discipline.<br/> <br/>Drawing on new critical approaches and examples selected from a wide geographical range, this course explores the role of archaeology in the creation and elaboration of national identities from the eighteenth century to the present day. Issues include the institutionalization of archaeology; the development of museums and practices of display and interpretation; the creation of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations; cultural property legislation and repatriation of artifacts; and archaeology and monuments under totalitarian regimes."

The course begins with an introduction to philosophical ethics, the scientific evidence in support of an anthropogenic role in climate change, and some advanced technological approaches to mitigating the effects of climate change. After these introductory sessions the class is split into two parts. We will begin with an exploration of how far reaching our ethical responsibilities are by questioning which things matter morally: are future-human beings, non-human animals, and ecosystems morally important? How do they compare morally to humans alive today? In the second part of the course we will focus on how individually specific our ethical responsibilities are. We will focus on a range of common behaviors relevant to climate change and ask whether and how we can ethically justify our individual participation or lack of participation in these behaviors. We will conclude the course by asking how our moral responsibilities with respect to climate change fit with our other moral responsibilities."

For these purposes, we will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (including sociology, history, anthropology, cultural studies, health sciences, economics, law, and political science). We will investigate the tensions between the individual and the group; the idiosyncratic and the shared; the local and the global; the national, transnational, and international; the context-bound and the universal. We will identify - and learn how to avoid - such common pitfalls as stigmatization, stereotyping, miserabilism, romanticization, and exoticization.

Insecurity and daunting scarcity of physical and legal resources are ever more parts and parcels of displaced communities' lives. Health disparities and death rates are particularly high among these communities and have long-term social and psychological effects on the lives of the survivors. This course focuses on health disparities and differentiated mortality rates in order to tackles issues of (il)legality, citizenship, and integration among contemporary displaced communities around the world. It proposes to investigate people's lives and deaths in times of displacement and indeterminacy to ask: What legal and political constraints reinforce health disparities and social inequalities among displaced communities? To what extent refugees' appeal for rights to citizenship and to health can go beyond the conventional forms of sovereign state power? What are the benefits and limits of (non)governmental organizations' services for displaced communities? Knowledge of these efforts calls attention to the achievements and shortcomings of humanitarianism, the lesser-recognized ways that displaced communities heal and survive political and environmental instabilities, and the possible approaches that governmental authorities and the international community could implement in their agenda for the global displacement crisis. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary and research-intensive course uses ethnographic studies to model successful qualitative research designs for students. Further, by familiarizing them with the main theoretical approaches in ethnographic research, it helps them develop a critical lens towards the current national and transnational regimes of care in relation to displaced people. It has large implications for students who are interested in global health, physical and mental health disparities among migrant communities, international legal frameworks, human rights and humanitarianism, and national laws and citizenship status. Key topics of the course will include: national and international policies to the current displacement crisis, humanitarian interventions, legality and transnationalism, the global economy of care, and human rights in theory and practice."

It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges. <br/><br/>The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges. In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. <br/><br/>The course also will examine the security environment of the post-Cold War world, with a focus on Russia's efforts to assert what it sees as its right to a sphere of influence. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has proven deeply skeptical of Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.<br/><br/>As a final project, students will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia."

We will reflect on the reasons why individuals choose to become mobile, as well as the structural conditions that might compel them. Specifically, we will look at disparities between urban and rural populations, clashes over ownership of job markets in urban settings, and the formation of individual and collective migrant identities. The course will begin by studying how waves of migrants (within and across frontiers) after independence shaped contemporary ideologies of race and belonging in Latin America, and end with a reflection on what these trajectories can teach us about studying Latin American migrants in the &quot;Global North&quot; today. Furthermore, the course will investigate how migration pathways challenge accounts of unified Latin American and Latinx &quot;identities,&quot; yet also allow for diasporic coalitions.

This course examines a selection of cantos Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio in its cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the underground world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval urban life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Inferno and Purgatorio and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation."

While drawing from the fields of cinema and media studies, we will analyze how film, television, and social media have simultaneously reflected and constructed our desire for self-display.

Young Jewish men are afforded a glimpse of the intellectual vistas lying beyond the stifling confines of the traditional Jewish shtetl. Reviled in these traditional communities as &quot;heretics&quot; they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This &quot;imagined community&quot; was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly. <br/>It was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the &quot;Talush&quot; (&quot;the uprooted man&quot;) which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety.<br/>The course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day. In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national &quot;Home&quot; brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the &quot;Talush&quot; narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y. Berdichevsky, Y.H. Brenner, S.Y. Agnon, alongside excerpts from contemporary bestselling Israeli novels by Amos Oz, Ya'akov Shabtai and others."

Our first approach to this question will be a mathematical take on the anatomy of music. We will give mathematical models of musical objects: starting from the basic parameters of pitch, harmony, rhythm, and timbre, and then moving on to higher-level structures like melodies, scales, chords, and chord progressions, as well as musical operations and compositional techniques. We will end by discussing similarities between music and mathematics understood more broadly as intellectual activities. Are the acts of writing a piece of music and coming up with a mathematical proof similar in nature? Can our enjoyment/understanding of a piece of music be compared to the pleasure of following a subtle mathematical argument? No prior knowledge of music or mathematics will be assumed. Musical and mathematical examples will abound."

The death of the nation-state and the birth of the multinational corporation heralded this new epoch. Yet, in the epoch of off-shored refugee processing centers and border walls, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing to re-conceptualize border as equally the product of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements."

In turn, nationalism has contributed significantly to the development of archaeology as a modern discipline.<br/> <br/>Drawing on new critical approaches and examples selected from a wide geographical range, this course explores the role of archaeology in the creation and elaboration of national identities from the eighteenth century to the present day.

This seminar will focus on questions about the link between collective patterns of action and the responsibilities of individuals who choose (or refuse) to participate in these larger patterns. For example, are there obligations that apply fundamentally to groups of people? If so, what are their implications for individual members of those groups? How should we, as individuals, view our personal contributions to collectively produced goods and harms? When can we be said to be complicit in the wrongs perpetrated by others, or in the injustices associated with social institutions and practices we take part in?"

During the last 30 years, it has become a common point of reference for an array of disciplines that are concerned with scope, shape, and function of the different forms of violence associated with the modern nation state. In this class, we will carefully examine Benjamin's original text, explore its philosophical and literary context, become familiar with the major positions of the reception of the essay, and discuss its political relevance today.<br/>Reading might include, among others, authors such as Benjamin, Cohen, Kafka, Kant, Landauer, Sorel, Agamben, Derrida, Hamacher, Butler, and Menke."

The region witnessed revolutions, civil wars, and transitions in and out of democracy. Cities witnessed massive immigration from rural areas, fundamentally changing the structures of societies. Poverty rates dropped dramatically, literacy rates increased steadily, and public goods were provided to many regions formerly abandoned by the states. Countries' economic models went from depending mainly on the production and exports of raw materials (1870-1950s) to focus on industrialization by substituting imports (1950-1990s) and a relatively closed economy, to the reopening of the economy following the end of the Cold War.

Approaching Turkey's current political landscape through a historical as well as an inter-disciplinary conceptual lens, the course examines the following questions: What are the political ideologies that shape Turkish politics and what role do political parties representing these ideologies play? How much space for the political remains in a competitive authoritarian system? How does neoliberalism play out in people's every-day lives? In what way does political Islam inform politics? How has Turkish foreign policy evolved after the ?exit from democracy'? In what way do ethnic politics and social movements impact the larger political context? <br/><br/>These questions are guided by broader reflections on Turkey's current transformation from a secular to a post-secular regime and from a hybrid democratic system to competitive authoritarianism, on the role of religion in politics, and on Turkey's changing place in the global order."

Ahi?s? undergirds the modern concept of &quot;nonviolence,&quot; which refers to any spiritual, ethical, or political disposition that refuses to use violence in the navigation of daily life and/or in the resolution of conflict. The practice of nonviolence, by whatever name, is found in cultures around the globe and throughout history. Some people and communities feel a strong ethical or spiritual impulse toward nonviolence. For them, nonviolence is a matter of principle and may or may not also be seen as a tool for political change. For others, nonviolent strategies are ways to resolve social conflict at all levels.

Poland was no exception, as these two types of music became remarkable artistic and subversive cultural realms during the communist period in Poland. Even though rock was repeatedly attacked, banned, and relegated to illegal culture status it became an integral part of the Polish urban landscape under the communist rule. The rock and punk bands provided a (loud) voice and a space of freedom for the younger generations who were searching for their identity within the controlling and ominous communist state. In this class we will look at the phenomenon of massive popularity of Western rock and punk music along with the exceptional fame of music created by Polish artists as well as its significance in the Polish urban culture under communism."

It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges. <br/>The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges. In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. <br/>The course also will examine the security environment of the post-Cold War world, with a focus on Russia's efforts to assert what it sees as its right to a sphere of influence. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has proven deeply skeptical of Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system."

WCAS,SOCIOL 476-0-23 Topics in Sociological Analysis,Demography: Methods of Population Analysis,We 3:30PM - 6:20PM,170,SOCIOL Sem Rm 107 - 1812 Chi,[],,"&quot;Formal demography is characterized by a focus on the enduring collectivity of population and careful study of the processes responsible for changes in population size and composition. Of particular interest to the demographer, are the processes of fertility, mortality and migration. In addition to these three basic areas of research, demographers are also interested in a number of related issues within the broad social science and health research spectrum including marriage, retirement, segregation, disability and land use. At the heart of all of these empirical analyses of populations and related issues is a particular way of looking at the world and related set of methodological techniques.<br/><br/>This course aims to introduce students to this way of viewing the world. Namely, it will cover the the principal methodological tools used by demographers for studying changes in population size and composition including: basic measures of mortality, fertility and migration; life table construction; multiple decrement life tables; stable populations; population projections; age patterns of vital events; and event history analysis. Students will learn to apply these and other demographic methods through a series of weekly problem sets.&quot;"

The emphasis is on what are conventionally regarded in political science as &quot;qualitative&quot; methods for the analysis of a relatively small number of cases. In sociology, this field is generally known as comparative-historical methodology. The course focuses on recent methodological writing, though a few classical pieces are also included. The readings are not specific to any substantive subfield in political science or sociology. The course assumes no prior background in qualitative methodology, but the material is advanced."

Throughout the course students will gain familiarity with (i) academic writing and the academic article format; (ii) the peer review publication process; (iii) the practice of giving constructive feedback on peer work; and (iv) presenting research in conference presentation style. By the end of the course students will develop a detailed research proposal that will resemble the front end of an academic journal article. While there is no one size fits all way to do research, this class will emphasize strategies conducive to writing a peer review journal article that can be applied to other academic endeavors as well (e.g. dissertation proposal development etc.). <br/><br/>This is a practical course aimed at helping students who are just starting out on a research project. This is not a course in the philosophy of research design and/or research methods. Although students may have a range of backgrounds and expertise we will focus on the fundamentals so that even those early on in their research careers gain familiarity with both the research process and the professional aspects of sociological research.&quot;"

But what if what I experience, feel, suffer, or even imagine, has actually never happened to me? Do experiences belong exclusively to someone or are they somehow collective? Can I feel, or perhaps share, the pain (and joy) of others? Can I give voice to somebody else's experience, if not out of identification, at least out of empathy? How ethical or opportunistic would that be? At the same time, what if I cannot properly articulate my own experiences without imagining the experience of others? What happens when I realize that my own feelings derive from somebody else's narrated experience? In short, what are the boundaries between appropriation of the other's experience and authentic identification? <br/>According to the Oxford Dictionary, vicarious refers to that which is experienced &quot;through the feelings or actions of another person.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;vicarious fictions,&quot; the narrator, or even the author, appropriates someone else's experience in order to produce accounts of their own lives and selves. In many cases, they vicariously narrate distant historical events - such as dictatorships, wars, and genocides - as they were witnessed by someone else. In this course we will read a number of Latin American novels that emerged in the last two decades (2000-2018), in which the narrators put themselves in someone else's shoes, and yet, do not appropriate or ventriloquize the other. Their narrators or protagonists often relive or reenact events that may seem distant, temporally and/or spatially, but which still resonate in contemporary lives as part of the collective imagination. They may also revisit historical periods through the lenses of a narrator who is affected by events which they did neither live or witness; they might instead have heard if from their parents, a friend, or even read about it in the newspaper or history books. By reading such vicarious fictions, we will reflect upon issues of cultural heritage, historical subjectivity and identity. We will critically engage with contemporary narratives to think about the ideological, historical, sociological and philosophical consequences of constructing the present and the contemporary self by revisiting and revaluing the past and the inherited culture/history."

Throughout the term, we will frame our discussions to consider the following questions: What is Latin American Literature and how has it been understood? Are there common characteristics in the cultural practices of the region that allow us to label them as belonging to a specific category? Is there more than geography in the unity of Latin America? Does Latin America even exist? What does it mean to produce art as a Latin American and why is it different? We will review a variety of literary styles, forms, and concerns, as well as different ideological constructions, to see how artists and thinkers have grappled with these questions since the late 19th century."

The second part of the course will be largely devoted to the presentation of the student research in an oral report that will lead to a paper of no less than 2000 words. The course will examine various aspects of the literature and culture of Spain, mainly from the Roman conquest (218 B.C. to the year 19 B.C.) and domination of most of the land by Rome (19 B.C. to the beginning of the Visigoth domination in 468 A.D.), the introduction and development of Christianity, the Visigoth domination and its Catholic kingdom (415-711 A.D.), the Muslim invasion (711), and the great Christian victory of Navas de Tolosa in 1212 A.D. which led to the re-conquest of most of the territory of the peninsula by the mid thirteenth century with the exception of the Muslim kingdom of Granada, which was finally defeated in 1492. We will read pages from a cultural history, texts from the earliest manifestations of Spanish prose, from the earliest manifestations of Spanish lyric, from the Cantar del Cid, and from a few Medieval poems, and watch numerous videos and films on Medieval art, culture, and the march of history and hear student reports on various cultural topics."

By examining trajectories of intra- and inter-national migration within and out of Latin America, this course will explore the social, cultural, economic, and political histories that reveal relationships between migration and larger global and postcolonial socio-economic forces. We will reflect on the reasons why individuals choose to become mobile, as well as the structural conditions that might compel them. Specifically, we will look at disparities between urban and rural populations, clashes over ownership of job markets in urban settings, and the formation of individual and collective migrant identities. The course will begin by studying how waves of migrants (within and across frontiers) after independence shaped contemporary ideologies of race and belonging in Latin America, and end with a reflection on what these trajectories can teach us about studying Latin American migrants in the &quot;Global North&quot; today. Furthermore, the course will investigate how migration pathways challenge accounts of unified Latin American and Latinx &quot;identities,&quot; yet also allow for diasporic coalitions. Course materials include canonical readings from anthropology and history, along with media texts such as films and other visual media."

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-Gómez, Rita Laura Segato, Verónica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a &quot;potencia feminista&quot; (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as &quot;zapatismo&quot; and its political principle of &quot;governing obeying&quot;? <br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a &quot;knowledge dispositive&quot; (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to María Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-Góme, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."

We will examine a diverse array of texts - poetry, novels, short stories, films and critical essays - produced in both Spanish and English both in the Caribbean and in the United States by writers of Puerto Rican, Dominican and Cuban origin. As we read, we will use exile and diaspora as lenses through which to interrogate other aspects of Latinx-Caribbean literature. How are these experiences portrayed, and what role have they played in the construction of identities, both personal and collective? How have these situations shaped the development of Caribbean communities (both physical and literary) within the continental U.S.? Should exile and diaspora be seen as patterns connected to globalization, thus serving to complicate our idea of what is Caribbean, or can they in fact be seen as fundamental to the construction of Caribbean-ness? We will look at how these movements affect the treatment of race and gender in these works, and we will analyze the role of nostalgia and humor in the navigation of different cultural and geographic spaces. <br/><br/>Readings will be drawn from the work of the following authors: Édouard Glissant, Antonio Benítez Rojo, Stuart Hall, Sylvia Wynter, Rubén Ríos Ávila, Pedro Pietri, Reinaldo Arenas, Manuel Ramos Otero, Aurora Arias, Josefina Báez, Pedro Cabiya, Legna Rodríguez Iglesias, Rita Indiana Hernández, Frank Báez, and Urayoán Noel, among others.
